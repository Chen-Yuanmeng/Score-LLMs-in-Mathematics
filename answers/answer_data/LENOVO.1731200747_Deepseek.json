        "model_output": " This question involves finding the distribution of a random variable that is a function of multiple independent random variables. \n\nThe random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3,$ and $X_4$ are independent of each other and follow a standard normal distribution. This means that each of these random variables has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and their values are distributed symmetrically around 0.\n\nThe given random variable is $\\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}}$. We can observe that this is a ratio of two random variables, and it is not in a form that corresponds to a known probability distribution.\n\nHowever, we can use the property of independence to simplify the problem. Since $X_1, X_2, X_3,$ and $X_4$ are independent, the random variables $X_1 - X_2$ and $X_3^2 + X_4^2$ are also independent. This is because the sum or difference of independent random variables is also independent, and the square of a standard normal random variable is an independent random variable.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerator $X_1 - X_2$. Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent standard normal random variables, their difference also follows a standard normal distribution. This is because the difference of two independent standard normal random variables is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance 2, which is still a standard normal distribution.\n\nNext, let's consider the denominator $\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}$. Since $X_3$ and $X_4$ are independent standard normal random variables, their squares are chi-square random variables with 1 degree of freedom. The sum of two independent chi-square random variables is also a chi-square random variable, so $X_3^2 + X_4^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The square root of a chi-square random variable with 2 degrees of freedom is a chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom.\n\nNow, we can use the property of independence again. The ratio of a standard normal random variable and a chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom follows a Cauchy distribution. This is because the ratio of a normal random variable and a chi distribution is a Cauchy random variable.\n\nTherefore, the random variable $\\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}}$ follows a Cauchy distribution.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{Cauchy}$. \n\nRegarding the confidence in the answer, since the reasoning and calculations involved in this problem are quite rigorous and rely on the properties of independent random variables and known probability distributions, I am $\\boxed{95\\%}$ confident in my answer.",

Since $X_1, X_2, X_3,$ and $X_4$ are independent, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are also independent. \n\n$Y_1$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $2$, because it is the difference of two independent standard normal random variables.
