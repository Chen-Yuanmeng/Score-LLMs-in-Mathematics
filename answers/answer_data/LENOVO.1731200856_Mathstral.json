Here's a step-by-step approach to this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a set of simple random samples and asked to test whether they are from a standard normal distribution at the significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n2. **Formulate the Null Hypothesis**: The null hypothesis is that the sample comes from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. In statistical terms, this is denoted as $H_0: \\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1$.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sample Mean and Standard Deviation**: The sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) is the average of the sample values, and the sample standard deviation ($s$) is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the sample.\n\n4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**: The test statistic for this problem is the sample mean divided by the sample standard deviation, which is denoted as $Z = \\frac{\\bar{x}}{s}$.\n\n5. **Determine the Rejection Region**: The rejection region is the range of values that would lead us to reject the null hypothesis. For a two-tailed test at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level, the rejection region is $Z < -1.96$ or $Z > 1.96$.\n\n6. **Make a Decision**: Compare the calculated test statistic to the rejection region. If it falls within the rejection region, reject the null hypothesis. If it doesn't, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n7. **State the Conclusion**: Based on the decision made in step 6, state the conclusion.\n\nWithout the actual calculations, I can't provide a numerical answer, but the final answer would be either \"Reject the null hypothesis\" or \"Fail to reject the null hypothesis\".\n\nAs for my confidence level, it's difficult to quantify without seeing the actual calculations, but I would say my confidence is around 80%. This is because I understand the concept of hypothesis testing and the steps involved, but I would need to see the specific values to be certain.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the conclusion depends on the calculated test statistic and its comparison with the rejection region, and my confidence level is around $\\boxed{80\\%}$.</s>",
