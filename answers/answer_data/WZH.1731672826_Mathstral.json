So, for vectors a=(7, 23) and b=(4, 0), the dot product is (7*4) + (23*0) = 28 + 0 = 28.\n\n2. **Find the magnitude of vector b**: The magnitude of a vector is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its entries. So, for vector b=(4, 0), the magnitude is sqrt((4^2) + (0^2)) = sqrt(16) = 4.\n\n3. **Find the projection vector of a on b**: The projection of a vector a onto another vector b is given by the dot product of a and b, divided by the magnitude of b, all multiplied by the unit vector in the direction of b. The unit vector in the direction of b is b divided by its magnitude. So, the projection vector of a on b is (28/4) * (1/4, 0/4) = 7 * (1/4, 0) = (7/4, 0).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{(7/4, 0)}.\n\nAs for the confidence level, I'm an AI language model, and I don't have personal experiences or emotions.

The projection of vector 'a' onto vector 'b' is a vector that is parallel to 'b' and has a magnitude that is the component of 'a' along 'b'. It's calculated using the dot product of 'a' and 'b' divided by the square of the magnitude of 'b'.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the dot product of 'a' and 'b'.\nThe dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding entries. So, for 'a' and 'b', it's (7*4) + (23*0) = 28 + 0 = 28.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the square of the magnitude of 'b'.\nThe magnitude of a vector is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So, the magnitude of 'b' is sqrt((4*4) + (0*0)) = sqrt(16) = 4. The square of this is 16.\n\nStep 3: Divide the dot product by the square of the magnitude of 'b'.\nThis gives us 28 / 16 = 1.75.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the result by the vector 'b'.\nThis gives us the projection vector, which is (1.75*4, 1.75*0) = (7, 0).\n\nSo, the projection vector of 'a' on 'b' is (7, 0).\n\nAs for my confidence level, I would say it's 100%.
