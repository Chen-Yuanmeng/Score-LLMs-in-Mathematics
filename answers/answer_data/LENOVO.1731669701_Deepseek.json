So, we can simplify $(2^3)^2$ to $2^{3*2}$ which equals $2^6$.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the expression.\nNow we have $2^6{\\div} 2^5$. \nThe exponent rule $a^m{\\div} a^n = a^{m-n}$ tells us that when we divide two exponents with the same base, we subtract the exponents. So, we can simplify $2^6{\\div} 2^5$ to $2^{6-5}$ which equals $2^1$.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression.\nFinally, $2^1$ equals 2.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.
