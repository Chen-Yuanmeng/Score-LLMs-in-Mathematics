So we start with multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, we have $(-3) \\times  4$. Multiplying a negative number by a positive number gives a negative result, so $(-3) \\times  4 = -12$.\n\nThen, we have $-12 \\div  (-2)$. Dividing a negative number by another negative number gives a positive result, so $-12 \\div  (-2) = 6$.\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the expression: $6 + 5$.\n\nFinally, we add these numbers together: $6 + 5 = 11$.\n\nSo, $(-3) \\times  4 \\div  (-2) + 5 = 11$.\n\nNow let's express our confidence in the correctness of our answer. The answer is $\\boxed{11}$. We are very confident in our answer because we followed the correct order of operations and got the correct answer.",
