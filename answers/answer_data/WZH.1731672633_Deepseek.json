To find $AB$, we perform matrix multiplication.\n\nRecall that to multiply two matrices, we take the dot product of the rows of the first matrix with the columns of the second. The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the resulting matrix is the dot product of the $i$-th row of the first matrix and the $j$-th column of the second.\n\nThe first row of $A$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, and the first column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 4\\end{pmatrix}$. The dot product of these is $1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 4 = 2$. So the first row and first column entry of $AB$ is $2$.\n\nThe first row of $A$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, and the second column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ 5\\end{pmatrix}$. The dot product of these is $1 \\cdot 3 + 0 \\cdot 5 = 3$. So the first row and second column entry of $AB$ is $3$.\n\nThe second row of $A$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$, and the first column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ 4\\end{pmatrix}$. The dot product of these is $0 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$. So the second row and first column entry of $AB$ is $4$.\n\nThe second row of $A$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$, and the second column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ 5\\end{pmatrix}$. The dot product of these is $0 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 5 = 5$. So the second row and second column entry of $AB$ is $5$.\n\nTherefore, $AB = \\begin{pmatrix}2 & 3\\\\4 & 5\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nI am $100\\%$ confident in my answer.",
