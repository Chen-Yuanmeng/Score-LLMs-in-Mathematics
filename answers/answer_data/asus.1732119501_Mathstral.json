        "model_output": " Sure, let's solve the differential equation step by step.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to find the general solution of the homogeneous equation ${y}'' -3{y}' +2y=0$.\n\nThe characteristic equation is ${r^2}-3r+2=0$. Factoring, we get $(r-1)(r-2)=0$, so the roots are $r=1$ and $r=2$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $y_h(x) = c_1e^x + c_2e^{2x}$.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find a particular solution $y_p(x)$ of the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term $xe^{2x}$ is not of the form $e^{kx}(P(x)\\cos(nx) + Q(x)\\sin(nx))$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials and $k, n$ are constants, we will try a particular solution of the form $y_p(x) = Ax^2e^{2x} + Bxe^{2x} + Ce^{2x}$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute $y_p(x)$ into the original equation:\n\n$(2Ax^2 + 2Bx + C)e^{2x} - 3(2Ax + B)e^{2x} + 2(Ax^2 + Bx + C)e^{2x} = xe^{2x}$.\n\nSimplify and collect like terms:\n\n$4Ax^2 + 4Ax + 2C = xe^{2x}$.\n\nStep 4: By comparing coefficients, we get the system of equations:\n\n$4A = 0$,\n$4A + 2B = 1$,\n$2C = 0$.\n\nSolving this system, we find $A=0$, $B=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $C=0$.

        "model_output": " The differential equation provided is ${y}'' -3{y}' +2y=xe^{2x}$. To solve this, we will first find the homogeneous solution, then find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation.\n\nStep 1: Find the characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation ${y}'' -3{y}' +2y=0$. This is done by replacing ${y}''$ with $m^2$, ${y}'$ with $m$, and $y$ with $1$, resulting in $m^2 -3m +2=0$.\n\nStep 2: Solve the characteristic equation to find its roots. The roots are $m=1$ and $m=2$. Since both roots are real and distinct, the homogeneous solution is $y_h=c_1e^x+c_2e^{2x}$.\n\nStep 3: To find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation, we use the method of undetermined coefficients. The non-homogeneous term is $xe^{2x}$, which suggests a particular solution of the form $y_p=Ax+Bxe^{2x}$.\n\nStep 4: Differentiate $y_p$ twice to find ${y_p}'$ and ${y_p}''$. We get ${y_p}'=A+Be^{2x}+2Bxe^{2x}$ and ${y_p}''=2Be^{2x}+4Bxe^{2x}$.\n\nStep 5: Substitute ${y_p}', {y_p}''$, and $y_p$ into the original differential equation. This results in $2Be^{2x}+4Bxe^{2x}-3(A+Be^{2x}+2Bxe^{2x})+2(Ax+Bxe^{2x})=xe^{2x}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation from Step 5 to $xe^{2x}=-A-3Be^{2x}$.\n\nStep 7: Since $xe^{2x}$ has no $e^{2x}$ term, we set $A=0$ and $B=-1$. This gives us $y_p=Bxe^{2x}=-xe^{2x}$.\n\nStep 8: Combine the homogeneous and particular solutions to find the general solution. This is $y=c_1e^x+c_2e^{2x}-xe^{2x}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $y=\\boxed{c_1e^x+c_2e^{2x}-xe^{2x}}$. I am 100% confident in my answer.</s>",

        "model_output": " Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Find the homogeneous solution:** The homogeneous equation is ${y}'' -3{y}' +2y=0$.
