First, perform the division \\(8 \\div 7\\):\n   \\[\n   8 \\div 7 \\approx 1.1428571428571428\n   \\]\n   This is a repeating decimal, but for our calculation, we will use the exact value up to the necessary precision.\n\n2. Next, multiply the result of the division by 3:\n   \\[\n   1.1428571428571428 \\times 3 = 3.4285714285714286\n   \\]\n   We need to round this result to four decimal places. The digit in the fifth decimal place is 7, which is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up the fourth decimal place from 5 to 6. Therefore, the rounded result is:\n   \\[\n   3.4286\n   \\]\n\n3. My confidence level in this answer is 100% because I have performing the calculations step-by-step and ensuring that the rounding is done correctly according to standard mathematical rules.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.4286}\n\\]",
