So, $0{\\div} 998$ is just $0$.\n\nThen, we subtract $998$ from this. But remember, zero minus any number is just the negative of that number. So, $0 - 998$ is $-998$.\n\nSo, the answer to $0{\\div} 998- 998$ is $-998$.\n\nBut let's put it in a box like this to show that we're done: $\\boxed{-998}$.\n\nNow, let's give our confidence in percentage level. We're pretty confident in this answer, so let's give it a 100%!",

So, $0{\\div} 998$ is undefined. \n\nHowever, we can rewrite this division as a multiplication. The division $a{\\div} b$ is the same as $a$ multiplied by the reciprocal of $b$. So, $0{\\div} 998$ is the same as $0$ multiplied by the reciprocal of $998$, which is $0$. \n\nSo, we have $0 - 998$. \n\nSubtracting any number from zero gives us the negation of that number. So, $0 - 998 = -998$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{-998}$.\n\nI am $\\boxed{100\\%}$ confident in my answer because I followed the rules of division and subtraction correctly.",
