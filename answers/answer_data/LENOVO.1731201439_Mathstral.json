The t-distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution that is typically used for inferential statistics, particularly in situations where sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\n2. The t-distribution has one parameter called the degrees of freedom (df), often denoted as $n$. The degrees of freedom for a t-distribution is one less than the number of data points used to calculate a statistic.\n\n3. The expected value (or mean) of a t-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom is defined. However, it's important to note that the t-distribution, like the normal distribution, is symmetric around its mean, which is also its median and mode. This symmetry implies that the expected value of the t-distribution is 0.\n\n4. Therefore, the expectation $EX$ of $X$ (where $X$ follows a t-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom) is indeed $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I'm fairly confident in this answer, but it's always important to note that the t-distribution is a complex topic and there could be nuances or specific contexts that I might not be aware of. My confidence level is around $\\boxed{80\\%}$.</s>",
