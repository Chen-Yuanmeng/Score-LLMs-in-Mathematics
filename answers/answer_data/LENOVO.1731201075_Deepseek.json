First, let's calculate the expected frequencies for each year under the null hypothesis of a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nSince there are 4 categories (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors), and 600 students in total, the expected frequency for each category would be 600/4 = 150.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Chi-square statistic:\n\nχ² = Σ[(observed frequency - expected frequency)² / expected frequency]\n\nFor freshmen: χ² = (150 - 150)² / 150 = 0\nFor sophomores: χ² = (165 - 150)² / 150 = 15² / 150 = 2.25\nFor juniors: χ² = (145 - 150)² / 150 = 5² / 150 = 0.1667\nFor seniors: χ² = (140 - 150)² / 150 = 10² / 150 = 0.6667\n\nχ² = 0 + 2.25 + 0.1667 + 0.6667 = 3.0834\n\nNow, let's compare this value to the critical value from the Chi-square distribution table. With 3 degrees of freedom (4 categories - 1) and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 7.81.\n\nSince our calculated Chi-square statistic (3.0834) is less than the critical value (7.81), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
