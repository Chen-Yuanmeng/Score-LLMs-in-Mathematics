        "model_output": " To calculate the sum of the inside angles of a convex octagon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the sum of the inside angles of a polygon with n sides. The formula for this is $(n - 2) \\times 180^{\\circ}$.\n\n2. In our case, the polygon is an octagon, which has 8 sides. So, we substitute $n = 8$ into the formula.\n\n3. This gives us $(8 - 2) \\times 180^{\\circ} = 6 \\times 180^{\\circ}$.\n\n4. Multiplying 6 by $180^{\\circ}$ gives us $1080^{\\circ}$.\n\nSo, the sum of the inside angles of a convex octagon is $\\boxed{1080^{\\circ}}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I am 100% confident in my answer because this is a straightforward application of the formula for the sum of the inside angles of a polygon, which is a basic concept in geometry.</s>",

The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides.\n\n2. So, for an octagon, the calculation would be (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the interior angles of a convex octagon is $\\boxed{1080}$ degrees.\n\nAs for the confidence level, given the formula and the straightforward nature of the calculation, I would rate my confidence as 95%.</s>",
