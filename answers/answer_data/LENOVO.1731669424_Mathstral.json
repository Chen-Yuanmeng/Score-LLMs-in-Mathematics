Therefore, we cannot directly determine the minimum value from the function's symmetry.\n\nStep 3: Find the derivative of the function.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is given by $f'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2$.\n\nStep 4: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\nWe have $4x^3 - 12x^2 = 0$. Factoring out $4x^2$, we get $4x^2(x - 3) = 0$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.\n\nStep 5: Determine the nature of these critical points.\nWe can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is $f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x$. Evaluating this at our critical points, we get:\n- At $x = 0$, $f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 24(0) = 0$. This is inconclusive, so we need to test this point using another method.\n- At $x = 3$, $f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) = 36 > 0$. This is a minimum point.\n\nStep 6: Test the inconclusive point using another method.\nWe can use the first derivative test. Looking at the sign of $f'(x)$, we see that it changes from negative to positive at $x = 0$. Therefore, this is also a minimum point.\n\nStep 7: Find the minimum value of the function.\nWe substitute our minimum point $x = 0$ back into the original function to get $f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^3 + 10 = 10$.\n\nStep 8: State the minimum value.\nThe minimum value of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nConfidence Level: I am confident in my answer at 95% because I have followed standard mathematical procedures for finding the minimum value of a function. However, I have not checked all possible methods for confirming the minimum, such as using a graphing calculator or more advanced mathematical tools.</s>",
