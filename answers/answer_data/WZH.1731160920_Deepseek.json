        "model_output": " The center of gravity, the inner center, and the outer center of a general triangle are always collinear. This is known as the Euler line of the triangle.\n\nThe center of gravity (or centroid) of a triangle is the point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The center of gravity of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the center of gravity being closer to the midpoint of the side.\n\nThe inner center of a triangle is the intersection point of the three angle bisectors of the triangle. An angle bisector of a triangle is a straight line that divides one angle of the triangle into two equal angles.\n\nThe outer center of a triangle is the intersection of the circumcenter and the nine-point center of the triangle. The circumcenter of a triangle is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle, and the nine-point center is the center of the circle that passes through the three midpoints of the sides and the three feet of the altitudes of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{Center of Gravity, Inner Center, Outer Center}$.\n\nI am 100% confident in this answer.",
