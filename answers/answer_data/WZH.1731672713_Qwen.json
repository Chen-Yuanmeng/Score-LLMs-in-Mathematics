We can do this by performing row reduction to bring the matrix into its row echelon form.\n\nFirst, let's write down the matrix:\n\\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\2 & 4\\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWe start by subtracting 2 times the first row from the second row to eliminate the first element in the second row:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\2 & 4\\end{pmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\0 & 0\\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there is only one non-zero row. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is 1.\n\nTo confirm our answer, let's check the determinant of the matrix. The determinant of a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\( \\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\\\c & d\\end{pmatrix} \\) is given by \\( ad - bc \\). For our matrix \\( A \\):\n\\[ \\det(A) = (1)(4) - (2)(2) = 4 - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the matrix is not invertible, and its rank must be less than 2. Since we already determined that there is one non-zero row in the row echelon form, the rank is indeed 1.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the matrix \\( A \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nSince the row reduction and determinant calculations confirm our answer, my confidence level in percentage regarding the answer is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
