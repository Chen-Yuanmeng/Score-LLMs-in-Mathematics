        "model_output": " Step 1: The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model given some observed data. In this case, we are trying to find the MLEs for $\\mu$ (the mean) and $\\sigma^2$ (the variance) of a normal distribution given two independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$.\n\nStep 2: The likelihood function for a normal distribution is given by the probability density function (pdf) of the normal distribution, which is $f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$.\n\nStep 3: Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are iid, the joint likelihood function is the product of their individual pdfs, which is $L(\\mu, \\sigma^2) = f(x_1; \\mu, \\sigma^2)f(x_2; \\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nStep 4: To find the MLEs, we need to maximize the likelihood function. This is typically done by taking the partial derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the parameters, setting them equal to zero, and solving for the parameters.\n\nStep 5: The log likelihood function is $l(\\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\ln L(\\mu, \\sigma^2) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2$.\n\nStep 6: Taking the partial derivative of $l(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with respect to $\\mu$ and setting it equal to zero gives $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.\n\nStep 7: Taking the partial derivative of $l(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with respect to $\\sigma^2$ and setting it equal to zero gives $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\sigma^2} = -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^4}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2$.\n\nStep 8: Substituting the expression for $\\mu$ from Step 6 into the expression for $\\sigma^2$ from Step 7 gives $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j)^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum likelihood estimates for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are $\\boxed{\\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}$ and $\\boxed{\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j)^2}$.\n\nRegarding my confidence in the answer:\n\nI have a high confidence level in the answer, as the steps followed are standard procedures in finding maximum likelihood estimates for normal distributions. The likelihood function was correctly derived, and the partial derivatives were correctly taken and set equal to zero to find the MLEs. However, without specific values for $X_1$ and $X_2$, I cannot calculate an exact percentage confidence level.</s>",
