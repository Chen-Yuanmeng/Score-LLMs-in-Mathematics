This means $f(x)$ is concave down in these intervals, and we should test the critical points. We already know that $f(x)$ is not concave down at $x=0$, $x=1$ or $x=7$.\n\n9. **Determine whether a point is a local maxima or minima**: The critical point that is a local maximum should have $f''(x)$ change from positive to negative at that point, or $f''(x)$ is positive on one side and negative on the other side. Since $f''(x) < 0$ for both $x=0,1$, we conclude that one of the two is a local minimum.\n\nNow, to determine which one, plug the critical points into $f(x)$. We know, f(x) = x^4(x-1)^3. Using this, f'(x) is defined at 0 but undefined at x=7. However, at 7 we find a horizontal asymptote for the given function f(x) by solving lim x->inf f(x), f(7) gives us f(x) value of zero, for which the given equation of the function, has no local maxima. Therefore, the local maxima for f(x) is between the interval (0,1). Since f''(x) is less than zero between interval (0,1), we check at 1. To confirm this, find the limit of the difference quotient of the function, (f(h)-f(0))/h where h approaches 0 from the right and from the left. As h approaches 0 from the right f(h) gives a local maxima when f'(x) > 0 for x=1 which is a local maxima since f(x) is continuous, differentiable at x=1.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n Confidence level: $\\boxed{90\\%}$.<|eot_id|>",
