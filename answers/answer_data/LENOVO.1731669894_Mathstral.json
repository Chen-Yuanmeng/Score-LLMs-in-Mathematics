Let's break it down:\n\nStep 1: Perform the division first, according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n$789 \\div 3 = 263$\n\nStep 2: Then, perform the multiplication:\n$263 \\times 4 = 1052$\n\nSo, the answer to $789 \\div 3 \\times 4$ is $\\boxed{1052}$.\n\nAs for my confidence in this answer, it's quite high. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) ensures that calculations are performed in the correct order, and the operations themselves are straightforward. However, it's always a good idea to double-check your calculations to be sure.</s>",
