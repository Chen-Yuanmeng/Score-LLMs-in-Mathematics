In this case, we are looking for values of $x$ for which the denominator of the fraction is zero, because division by zero is undefined. \n\nIn the function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} +\\ln{(e^{x} +1 )} $, the denominator of the fraction is $x$. So, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$x = 0$\n\nSo, the function has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$.\n\nHorizontal Asymptotes:\nA function has a horizontal asymptote at $y=b$ if the function approaches $b$ as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity. In this case, we are looking for the behavior of the function as $x$ becomes very large (either positive or negative).\n\nAs $x$ becomes very large, the term $\\frac{1}{x}$ becomes very small and approaches zero. Also, the term $\\ln{(e^{x} +1 )}$ becomes very large and approaches infinity. This is because the natural logarithm function $\\ln{(x)}$ grows very slowly compared to the exponential function $e^{x}$, and as $x$ becomes very large, $e^{x}$ becomes much larger than $1$, making $\\ln{(e^{x} +1 )}$ approach infinity.\n\nTherefore, as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, the function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} +\\ln{(e^{x} +1 )}$ approaches infinity. \n\nSo, the function has no horizontal asymptote.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} +\\ln{(e^{x} +1 )}$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$ and no horizontal asymptote. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{x=0}$.\n\nConfidence: 80%",
