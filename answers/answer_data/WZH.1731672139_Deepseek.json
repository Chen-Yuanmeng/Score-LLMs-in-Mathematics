        "model_output": " In geometry, parallel lines are lines that never intersect, i.e., they always maintain the same distance apart. \n\nWhen two lines are parallel, the isotopic angles are equal. This is because the angles formed by the lines with a transversal line (a line that intersects the two parallel lines) are equal. This is known as the Corresponding Angles Postulate.\n\nThe corresponding angles postulate states that if a transversal line intersects two parallel lines, then the pairs of corresponding angles are congruent (equal in measure). \n\nIn other words, if line A is parallel to line B, and line T intersects both lines A and B, then the angles formed at the points of intersection are equal.\n\nSo, if we have two parallel lines, say line A and line B, and a transversal line T intersects them at points P and Q respectively, then the corresponding angles will be equal. That is, angle 1 = angle 2, angle 3 = angle 4, and angle 5 = angle 6.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the isotopic angles of two parallel lines is that they are equal.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{Equal}$. And I am $\\boxed{100\\%}$ confident in this answer.",
