        "model_output": "To find the distance from the center of the circle to the chord, we can use the formula for the length of the median to the chord, which is also the distance from the center of the circle to the chord. This formula involves the radius of the circle and the length of the chord.\n\nFirst, draw a diagram of the situation:\n\nIn this diagram, let M be the midpoint of the chord AB. The length of AM (or BM) is half the length of AB, which is 8/2 = 4.\n\nNext, draw a perpendicular line from O to AB, meeting AB at point P.\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle OMP to find the distance OP.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (OM) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (OP and MP).\n\nWe know the length of OM is 5 (the radius of the circle), and the length of MP is 4 (half the length of AB). \n\nLet's denote the length of OP as x.\n\nThen the Pythagorean theorem gives:\n\n5^2 = x^2 + 4^2\n25 = x^2 + 16\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 25 - 16\nx^2 = 9\n\nx = √9\nx = 3\n\nSo the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{3}\n\nI am 99% confident in this answer.<|eot_id|>",
