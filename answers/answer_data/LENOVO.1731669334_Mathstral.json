The Taylor series expansion of a function $f(x)$ around $x=a$ is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + ...$$\n\nIn this case, we're looking for the Taylor series expansion of $(1+x)^\\pi$ at $x=0$.\n\nStep 1: Find $f(0)$.\nHere, $f(x) = (1+x)^\\pi$. So, $f(0) = (1+0)^\\pi = 1^\\pi = 1$.\n\nStep 2: Find $f'(x)$.\nUsing the chain rule, we get $f'(x) = \\pi(1+x)^{\\pi-1}$. So, $f'(0) = \\pi(1+0)^{\\pi-1} = \\pi$.\n\nStep 3: Find the first two terms of the Taylor series.\nThe first term is $f(0) = 1$, and the second term is $f'(0)(x-0) = \\pi x$.\n\nSo, the first two terms of the Taylor series expansion of $(1+x)^\\pi$ at $x=0$ are $1$ and $\\pi x$.\n\nConfidence Level: I'm 100% confident in this answer.
