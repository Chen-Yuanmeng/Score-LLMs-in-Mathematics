The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by $\\frac{a}{1 - r}$, but this only works if $|r| < 1$. Here, $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the series converges.\n\nNow, let's break the series into two separate series:\n\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{2n}{2^n} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{2^n}$.\n\nThe first series on the right-hand side is a geometric series with first term $a = 2$ and common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of this series is $\\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 4$.\n\nThe second series on the right-hand side is the same as the original series, but multiplied by $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, its sum is $\\frac{1}{2}$ times the sum of the original series. Let's denote the sum of the original series as $S$. Then we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}S = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 = 2$.\n\nSolving for $S$ gives $S = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{2n-1}{2^n}$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nMy confidence in this answer is $\\boxed{100\\%}$.",
