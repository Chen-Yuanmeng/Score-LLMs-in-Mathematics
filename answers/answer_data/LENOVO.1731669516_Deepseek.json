However, since we are evaluating a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant.\n\nNow, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\mathrm{dx} = F(b) - F(a)$. \n\nIn our case, $f(x) = x$, $a = 0$, and $b = 1$.
