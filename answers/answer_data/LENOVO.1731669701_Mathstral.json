        "model_output": " Sure, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the exponent on the left side of the equation: $(2^3)^2$. According to the rules of exponents, when you raise an exponent to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, $(2^3)^2 = 2^{3*2} = 2^6$.\n\n2. Now, the equation becomes $2^6 \\div 2^5$.\n\n3. Next, calculate the exponent when you divide two numbers with the same base. You subtract the exponents. So, $2^6 \\div 2^5 = 2^{6-5} = 2^1$.\n\n4. Finally, calculate the remaining exponent: $2^1 = 2$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I'm quite confident about this answer. I used the rules of exponents correctly, and there are no complex operations involved that could lead to an error. So, I would say my confidence level is 95%.</s>",

According to the rules of exponents, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, $(2^3)^2 = 2^{3\\times 2} = 2^6$.\n\n2. Next, we divide $2^6$ by $2^5$.
