        "occurrence": 3,
        "model_output": " Sure, I can help you with that. Here's how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to understand that we are dealing with two sets of samples, and we want to determine if they come from the same distribution.\n\n2. To do this, we can use the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is a non-parametric test used to compare two samples. The test statistic is the maximum absolute difference between the empirical distribution functions of the two samples.\n\n3. The null hypothesis is that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution.\n\n4. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, often denoted by $D$, is the maximum of the absolute difference between the cumulative distribution functions of the two samples at each data point.\n\n5. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the significance level (in this case, 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n6. However, calculating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic and the p-value by hand can be complex and time-consuming. It's usually done using a computer or a statistical software.\n\n7. Without performing the actual test, I can't provide a specific number for the p-value or the test statistic. However, I can say that if the p-value is less than 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the two samples do not come from the same distribution.\n\n8. As for the confidence level, it's not directly applicable in this scenario. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a frequentist method, which means it doesn't provide a probability of the hypothesis being true, but rather the probability of observing the data given the hypothesis is true (the p-value).\n\nSo, in conclusion, you would use a statistical software to perform the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and if the p-value is less than 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the two samples do not come from the same distribution. The confidence level is not directly applicable in this scenario.\n\nAs for my confidence in this answer, it's based on my understanding of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and its application. However, without performing the actual test, I can't say with certainty what the result would be. Therefore, I would rate my confidence at 80%.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{80%}}$</s>",
