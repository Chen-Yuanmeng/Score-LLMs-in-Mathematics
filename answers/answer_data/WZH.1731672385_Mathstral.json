        "model_output": " Sure, let's break this down:\n\n1. **Step 1:** A single line divides the plane into two areas.\n\n2. **Step 2:** If we add a second line, it intersects the first line at a point. This point creates two new areas, so now we have four areas.\n\n3. **Step 3:** If we add a third line, it intersects the first two lines at two new points. These points create two new areas, so now we have six areas.\n\n4. **Step 4:** However, we need to consider the possibility that the third line is parallel to one of the first two lines. In this case, it would intersect the other line at only one point, creating only one new area, for a total of five areas.\n\n5. **Step 5:** But if the third line is not parallel to any of the first two lines, it will intersect them at two points, creating two new areas, for a total of seven areas.\n\nSo, in the most general case where no two lines are parallel, three lines can divide the plane into at most seven areas.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{7}$\n\n**Confidence Level:** I'm 100% confident in this answer, as it is a basic principle of geometry.</s>",

Each intersection point divides the second line into two parts, and each part divides one of the existing areas into two, creating two new areas. So, a second line can add at most 2 more areas.\n\nStep 4: Add a third line\nA third line can intersect the first two lines at most twice (assuming the three lines are not parallel). Each intersection point divides the third line into two parts, and each part divides one of the existing areas into two, creating two new areas. So, a third line can add at most 4 more areas.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of areas\nSo, if we add these up, 3 lines can divide a plane into at most 2 (from the first line) + 2 (from the second line) + 4 (from the third line) = 8 areas.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}\n\nConfidence Level: I am 100% confident in this answer, as it follows directly from the basic principles of geometry.</s>",
