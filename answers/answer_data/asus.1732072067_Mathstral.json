        "model_output": " Sure, let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Step 1: Perform the division operation.**\n   The division operation in the expression is $9 \\div 3$. This equals $3$. So, the expression becomes $13 - 7 + 3$.\n\n2. **Step 2: Perform the subtraction operation.**\n   Now, we perform the subtraction operation. $13 - 7$ equals $6$. So, the expression becomes $6 + 3$.\n\n3. **Step 3: Perform the addition operation.**\n   Finally, we perform the addition operation. $6 + 3$ equals $9$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{9}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I'm quite confident. The operations were straightforward and followed the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). However, I don't have a percentage scale for my confidence, so I can't provide a specific percentage. But I believe my answer is correct and complete.</s>",
