        "model_output": " Sure, let's break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is a limit of an integral. The integral is of a function that is a fraction with a constant numerator and a denominator that is a sum of squares. The upper and lower limits of the integral are (a+1) and a respectively.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the integral\nThe function inside the integral is an even function because $\\frac{1}{1+x^2+a^2}$ is unchanged when x is replaced with -x. This means that the integral from a to a+1 is the same as the integral from -(a+1) to -a. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$\\int_{a}^{a+1}\\frac{ \\,dx}{1+x^2+a^2} = \\int_{-(a+1)}^{-a}\\frac{ \\,dx}{1+x^2+a^2}$\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the integral\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{1+x^2+a^2}$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\right)$ (this is a standard integral that can be found in a table of integrals).\n\nStep 4: Apply the limits of integration\nSubstituting the limits into the integral, we get:\n\n$\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\right)\\right]_{-(a+1)}^{-a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{-a}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-(a+1)}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\right)\\right)$\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the limit as a approaches 0\nAs a approaches 0, both terms inside the arctangent functions approach 0, so the difference between them approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the limit is $\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{1+a^2}}$.\n\nStep 6: Final answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{1+a^2}}}$.\n\nConfidence level: 100% - This is a standard problem of integration and limit evaluation that can be solved using basic calculus techniques.</s>",

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that the derivative of the definite integral of a function from a to b with respect to a is the function evaluated at b minus the function evaluated at a.\n\nStep 2: Notice that the denominator of the integrand is always positive, so the integrand is always positive. Therefore, the limit of the integral as a approaches 0 will be greater than or equal to the integral of the function when a=0.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the integral when a=0.\n$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{dx}{1+x^2}$\n\nStep 4: Recall the antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ is $\\arctan(x)$.\n$\\left[\\arctan(x)\\right]_{0}^{1}$\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit and lower limit.\n$\\arctan(1) - \\arctan(0)$\n\nStep 6: Recall that $\\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\arctan(0) = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\pi}{4} - 0$\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expression.\n$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nStep 8: Since the integrand is always positive, the limit of the integral as a approaches 0 will be equal to the value of the integral when a=0.
