Next, we perform the division operation: $-12 \\div (-2) = 6$\n3. Finally, we perform the addition operation: $6 + 5 = 11$\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nAs for the confidence level, I'm confident about this answer because I followed the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. I didn't skip or misinterpret any steps in the calculation. Therefore, I would rate my confidence level at 100%.</s>",
