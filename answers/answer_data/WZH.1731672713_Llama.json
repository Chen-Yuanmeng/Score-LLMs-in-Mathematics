The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.\n\n4. Looking at our upper triangular form, there are no rows or columns that are linearly independent since there's no non-zero value in the second row, which means there are no two linearly independent rows.\n\n5.
