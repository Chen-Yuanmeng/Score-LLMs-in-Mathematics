        "model_output": " The outer product of two vectors a and b is defined as the matrix A*B where A is the transpose of the vector a and B is the vector b. In this case, we have a = (1, 2, 3) and b = (4, 5, 6).\n\nThe transpose of a vector a = (a1, a2, a3) is a matrix A = [[a1], [a2], [a3]]. So, the transpose of a is A = [[1], [2], [3]].\n\nNow, we can calculate the outer product A*B:\n\nA*B = [[1, 2, 3],       [[4],   [5],   [6]]\n       [4, 5, 6]]\n\nThe outer product A*B is a 2x3 matrix. We can calculate each element of this matrix by multiplying the corresponding elements of the rows of A and the columns of B.\n\nFor example, the element in the first row and first column of A*B is (1*4) + (2*5) + (3*6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the rest of the elements of A*B:\n\nA*B = [[32, 42, 52],\n       [68, 85,102]]\n\nSo, the outer product of a and b is A*B = [[32, 42, 52], [68, 85,102]].\n\nNow, let's calculate the confidence in your answer. The answer is $\\boxed{[[\\boxed{32, 42, 52]}, [\\boxed{68, 85,102}]]}$. The confidence level is 100%.",
