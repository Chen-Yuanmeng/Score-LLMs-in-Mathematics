The differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. \n   The general form is: \n   $ay''+by'+cy=0$ where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants.\n\n   Here, 'a' is 1, 'b' is 0, and 'c' is -0.2.\n   \n   The equation is reduced to:\n   $y''=-0.2$ or $y''+0.2y=0$\n\n2. To solve this equation, we'll use the characteristic equation method.\n   The characteristic equation is obtained by substituting y = e^(rx) into the differential equation:\n   $r^2e^(rx) + 0.2e^(rx) = 0$\n\n3. Dividing the equation by $e^(rx)$, we get the characteristic equation:\n   $r^2 + 0.2 = 0$\n\n4. Now, we'll solve the characteristic equation for 'r'. \n   This is a quadratic equation in 'r', and it can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n   $r=\\frac{-b±\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ \n   Here, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 0.2.\n\n   Substituting the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula, we get:\n   $r=\\frac{-0±\\sqrt{0^2-4(1)(0.2)}}{2(1)}$\n   $r=\\frac{0±\\sqrt{-0.8}}{2}$\n   $r=\\frac{0±\\sqrt{0}i\\sqrt{0.8}}{2}$\n\n   Since $\\sqrt{0.8}=\\sqrt{4/5}$, we can rewrite this as \n   $r=\\frac{0±\\sqrt{4/5}i}{2}$\n   $r=\\frac{0±i\\sqrt{4/5}}{2}$ \n   $r=\\frac{0±i\\sqrt{4}}{2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n   $r=0±\\frac{2}{2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}i$ or $r=0±\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}i$\n\n   This simplifies to: \n   $r=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}i$ and $r=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}i$\n\n   Therefore, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex conjugates of each other.\n\n5.
