        "question_in_English": "Let the service life of energy-saving lamps produced by a certain factory follow $Exp (1/6000)$. After technical innovation the factory produced a new batch of energy-saving lamps. 20 energy-saving lamps were taken out for experimentation, and the experiment was stopped when the 5 one failed. The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps (in hours) were measured to be 6000, 6300 6600, 6700, and 6800, respectively. Has the average life of the energy-saving lamps increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05?",

        "model_output": " To determine if the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation, we can perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nFirst, we need to find the sample mean and sample standard deviation of the 5 energy-saving lamps. \n\nThe sample mean (x̄) is the sum of the measured working times divided by the number of lamps:\nx̄ = (6000 + 6300 + 6600 + 6700 + 6800) / 5 = 32400 / 5 = 6480 hours\n\nNext, we calculate the sample standard deviation (s) using the formula:\ns = sqrt[((sum of (x - x̄)^2) / (n - 1))]\n\nThe sum of (x - x̄)^2 for the 5 lamps is:\n(6000 - 6480)^2 + (6300 - 6480)^2 + (6600 - 6480)^2 + (6700 - 6480)^2 + (6800 - 6480)^2 = 230400 + 32400 + 14400 + 57600 + 102400 = 558000\n\nSo, the sample standard deviation is:\ns = sqrt(558000 / 4) = sqrt(139500) = 373.48 hours\n\nNow, we can perform the t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has not increased, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average life has increased. \n\nThe t-score is calculated as:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))\n\nWe are given that the service life of energy-saving lamps produced by the factory follows an exponential distribution with parameter 1/6000. Therefore, the mean (μ) of the distribution is 6000 hours. \n\nt = (6480 - 6000) / (373.48 / sqrt(5)) = 480 / (373.48 / 2.236) = 480 / 166.67 = 2.88\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 2.132.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (2.88) is greater than the critical t-value (2.132), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{True}$. \n\nRegarding the confidence in this answer, it is difficult to provide an exact confidence level without further information or calculations, as it depends on the assumptions made and the underlying distribution of the data. However, based on the t-test result and the significance level of 0.05, we can be fairly confident that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has indeed increased after technical innovation. The answer is $\\boxed{True, 75\\%}$.",
