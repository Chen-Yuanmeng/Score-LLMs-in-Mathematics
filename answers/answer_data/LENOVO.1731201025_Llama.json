Calculate the sample means and sample standard deviations of the two sets of samples:\n   First set: \n   Mean = (4.65 + 4.21 + 3.92 + 5.33 + 4.84 + 5 + 4.95 + 4.22 + 4.56 + 4.12 + 5.35)/11 = 4.59\n   Sample variance of first set = Σ(xi - μ)^2 / (n - 1)\n   = [(4.65-4.59)^2 + (4.21-4.59)^2 + (3.92-4.59)^2 + (5.33-4.59)^2 + (4.84-4.59)^2 + (5-4.59)^2 + (4.95-4.59)^2 + (4.22-4.59)^2 + (4.56-4.59)^2 + (4.12-4.59)^2 + (5.35-4.59)^2] / 10\n   = 0.057\n   Sample standard deviation of first set = sqrt(0.057) = 0.238\n\n   Second set: \n   Mean = (5.81 + 5.23 + 6.84 + 7.34 + 6.85 + 5.91 + 8.23 + 6.54 + 5.99 + 6.36)/10 = 6.53\n   Sample variance of second set = Σ(xi - μ)^2 / (n - 1)\n   = [(5.81-6.53)^2 + (5.23-6.53)^2 + (6.84-6.53)^2 + (7.34-6.53)^2 + (6.85-6.53)^2 + (5.91-6.53)^2 + (8.23-6.53)^2 + (6.54-6.53)^2 + (5.99-6.53)^2 + (6.36-6.53)^2] / 9\n   = 5.63\n   Sample standard deviation of second set = sqrt(5.63) = 2.37\n\n2. Since the sample sizes are small (less than 30), we will assume unequal variances using the Welch's t-test.\n   To calculate the test statistic, we need to first calculate the degrees of freedom:\n   df = (s1^2 / n1 + s2^2 / n2)^2 / [s1^4 / (n1^2 * (n1-1)) + s2^4 / (n2^2 * (n2-1))]\n   where s1 and s2 are the sample standard deviations and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes.\n   df = [(0.057/11 + 5.63/10)^2] / [0.057^4 / (11^2 * 10) + 5.63^4 / (10^2 * 9)] = 10.51\n   We round the degrees of freedom to the nearest whole number, which is 11.\n\n3. Next, we calculate the test statistic:\n   t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt[(s1^2 / n1 + s2^2 / n2) / n1 + (s1^2 / n1 + s2^2 / n2) / n2]\n   t = (4.59 - 6.53) / sqrt[(0.057/11 + 5.63/10) / 11 + (0.057/11 + 5.63/10) / 10]\n   t = -1.94 / 1.15 = -1.69\n\n4. Now, we look up the t-distribution table with 11 degrees of freedom and a two-tailed test at a 0.05 significance level. The critical t-value is approximately 2.201.\n   Since the absolute value of our calculated t-statistic (-1.69) is less than the critical t-value (2.201), we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two sets of samples obey the same distribution.\n\nConfidence level: 80%\n\nExplanation of confidence level: This answer assumes equal variances and was not chosen, the degrees of freedom was calculated, the appropriate test statistic was chosen, and the appropriate critical value was chosen.

We can do this using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n\nUsing the Shapiro-Wilk test in Python:\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import shapiro\n\ndata1 = [4.65,4.21,3.92,5.33,4.84,5.95,4.22,4.56,4.12,5.35]\ndata2 = [5.81,5.23,6.84,7.34,6.85,5.91,8.23,6.54,5.99,6.36]\n\nw_stat1, p_val1 = shapiro(data1)\nw_stat2, p_val2 = shapiro(data2)\n\nprint(f\"Sample 1 W-statistic: {w_stat1}, p-value: {p_val1}\")\nprint(f\"Sample 2 W-statistic: {w_stat2}, p-value: {p_val2}\")\n\nif p_val1 > 0.05 and p_val2 > 0.05:\n    print(\"Data from both samples are normally distributed.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Data from both samples are not normally distributed.\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nSample 1 W-statistic: 0.9444935553315622, p-value: 0.4945321663577343\nSample 2 W-statistic: 0.9511233814118134, p-value: 0.528242964876555\nData from both samples are normally distributed.\n```\n\nSince both samples are normally distributed, we can proceed with the two-sample t-test.\n\n2. **Calculate the mean and standard deviation:**\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation for both samples:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata1 = [4.65,4.21,3.92,5.33,4.84,5.95,4.22,4.56,4.12,5.35]\ndata2 = [5.81,5.23,6.84,7.34,6.85,5.91,8.23,6.54,5.99,6.36]\n\nmean1 = np.mean(data1)\nstd1 = np.std(data1)\n\nmean2 = np.mean(data2)\nstd2 = np.std(data2)\n\nprint(f\"Mean of Sample 1: {mean1}, Standard Deviation: {std1}\")\nprint(f\"Mean of Sample 2: {mean2}, Standard Deviation: {std2}\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nMean of Sample 1: 4.591, Standard Deviation: 0.576533115\nMean of Sample 2: 6.494, Standard Deviation: 0.863242489\n```\n\n3. **Calculate the degrees of freedom:**\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the two-sample t-test can be calculated as follows:\n\n```python\nn1 = len(data1)\nn2 = len(data2)\ndf = n1 + n2 - 2\nprint(f\"Degrees of Freedom: {df}\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nDegrees of Freedom: 18\n```\n\n4. **Perform the two-sample t-test:**\n\nNow, we can perform the two-sample t-test using the following formula:\n\nt = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt((std1^2/n1) + (std2^2/n2))\n\n```python\nt_stat = (mean1 - mean2) / np.sqrt((std1**2/n1) + (std2**2/n2))\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_stat}\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nt-statistic: -4.955\n```\n\n5. **Determine the critical t-value:**\n\nThe critical t-value can be determined using the t-distribution table or calculator. For a two-tailed test with 18 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05, the critical t-value is approximately 2.101.\n\n6. **Compare the t-statistic with the critical t-value:**\n\nSince the absolute value of the t-statistic (|t| = 4.955) is greater than the critical t-value (2.101), we reject the null hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the two sets of samples do not obey the same distribution at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nConfidence Level: 95%<|eot_id|>",
