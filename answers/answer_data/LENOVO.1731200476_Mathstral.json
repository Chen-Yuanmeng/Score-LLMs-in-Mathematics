        "model_output": " To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the function at that point (which gives us the slope of the tangent line) and then use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line.\n\nStep 1: Identify the function\nThe given function is $2(x^3+y^3)-9xy=0$. We can simplify this to $2x^3 + 2y^3 - 9xy = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Find the derivative of the function\nTo find the derivative of this function with respect to x, we'll need to use implicit differentiation. This means we'll treat y as a function of x and use the chain rule. The derivative of $2x^3$ with respect to x is $6x^2$. The derivative of $2y^3$ with respect to x is $6y^2 \\frac{dy}{dx}$ (using the chain rule). The derivative of $-9xy$ with respect to x is $-9y - 9x \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\nSo, our derivative is $6x^2 + 6y^2 \\frac{dy}{dx} - 9y - 9x \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. We get $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{9y - 6x^2}{6y^2 - 9x}$.\n\nStep 4: Find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2,1)\nWe substitute x = 2 and y = 1 into the equation for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2,1). This gives us $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{9*1 - 6*2^2}{6*1^2 - 9*2} = \\frac{-3}{-12} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nStep 5: Find the equation of the tangent line\nWe can now use the point-slope form of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, to find the equation of the tangent line. Substituting m = $\\frac{1}{4}$, $x_1$ = 2, and $y_1$ = 1, we get $y - 1 = \\frac{1}{4}(x - 2)$, which simplifies to $y = \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 6: Put the final answer within \\boxed\nThe final answer is the equation of the tangent line, which is $\\boxed{y = \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nI'm confident that this answer is correct, but please double-check it to make sure.
