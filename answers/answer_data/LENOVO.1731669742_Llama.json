Solving these equations gives us $x=3$ and $x=2$.\n\nStep 3: Test the intervals\nNow, we test the intervals $(-\\infty,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,\\infty)$ by choosing a test point from each interval.\n\nFor $x < 2$, choose $x=0$. Plugging this value into the inequality, we get $(0-3)(0-2) = 6$, which is positive. So, the inequality is not satisfied for $x < 2$.\n\nFor $2 < x < 3$, choose $x=2.5$. Plugging this value into the inequality, we get $(2.5-3)(2.5-2) = -0.25$, which is negative. So, the inequality is satisfied for $2 < x < 3$.\n\nFor $x > 3$, choose $x=4$. Plugging this value into the inequality, we get $(4-3)(4-2) = 2$, which is positive. So, the inequality is not satisfied for $x > 3$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the solution set\nBased on the intervals tested in Step 3, we see that the inequality $(x-3)(x-2) < 0$ is satisfied only for the interval $(2,3)$. Therefore, the solution set is $(2,3)$.\n\n\\boxed{(2,3)}\n\nConfidence level: 100%<|eot_id|>",
