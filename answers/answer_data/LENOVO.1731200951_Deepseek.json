The null hypothesis (H0) is that the regression coefficient is not significant, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the regression coefficient is significant. We will use the t-test for this purpose.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the t-statistic for the slope (b1) and the intercept (b0) using the following formulas:\n\nt_stat_b1 = b1 / se_b1\nt_stat_b0 = b0 / se_b0\n\nwhere se_b1 and se_b0 are the standard errors of the slope and the intercept, respectively.\n\nTo calculate the standard errors, we need the sum of squared errors (SSE), the number of observations (n), and the mean of x and y (x_bar and y_bar):\n\nSSE = Σ(y - y_hat)^2\nn = 10\nx_bar = Σx / n\ny_bar = Σy / n\n\nNow, let's calculate the t-statistic for the slope (b1) and the intercept (b0):\n\nt_stat_b1 = 0.818 / se_b1\nt_stat_b0 = 0.476 / se_b0\n\nNext, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 8 degrees of freedom (n - 2).
