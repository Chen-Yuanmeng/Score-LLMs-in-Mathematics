To determine if x = 3 is the global minimum, we need to check the end behavior of the function. As x approaches infinity, the term x^4 dominates the function, causing it to increase. As x approaches negative infinity, the term x^4 still dominates the function, causing it to increase.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that x = 3 is the global minimum of the function.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of the function at x = 3.\nf(3) = (3)^4 - 4(3)^3 + 10\nf(3) = 81 - 108 + 10\nf(3) = -17\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10 is -17.\n\n\\boxed{-17}\n\nConfidence Level: 100%<|eot_id|>",

        "model_output": "To find the minimum value of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10$, we can use calculus. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Find the derivative of the function**: \n   The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is denoted as $f'(x)$. Using the power rule of differentiation, we get:\n\n   $f'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2$\n\n2. **Find the critical points**:\n   Critical points occur when the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. In this case, we set $f'(x) = 0$:\n\n   $4x^3 - 12x^2 = 0$\n\n   Factoring out $4x^2$:\n\n   $4x^2(x - 3) = 0$\n\n   So, the critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.\n\n3. **Find the second derivative of the function**:\n   To determine whether the critical points correspond to a minimum or maximum, we need to examine the second derivative of the function. Taking the derivative of $f'(x)$, we get:\n\n   $f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x$\n\n4. **Determine the nature of the critical points**:\n   We evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n   - For $x = 0$, $f''(0) = -24 < 0$, which means $x = 0$ corresponds to a maximum.\n   - For $x = 3$, $f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) = 108 - 72 = 36 > 0$, which means $x = 3$ corresponds to a minimum.\n\n5. **Find the minimum value of the function**:\n   Since we have identified the minimum at $x = 3$, we substitute this value back into the original function to find the minimum value:\n\n   $f(3) = (3)^4 - 4(3)^3 + 10 = 81 - 108 + 10 = -17$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10$ is $\\boxed{-17}$.\n\n**Confidence level: 100%**<|eot_id|>",
