        "model_output": "To determine if the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n   - Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The average life of the energy-saving lamps has not increased, i.e., \\(\\mu = 6000\\) hours.\n   - Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): The average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased, i.e., \\(\\mu < 6000\\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sample Mean:**\n   The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps are 6000, 6300, 6600, 6700, and 6800 hours. The sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{x} = \\frac{6000 + 6300 + 6600 + 6700 + 6800}{5} = \\frac{33400}{5} = 6680 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n   Since we are dealing with a sample size of 5 and the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the t-test. The test statistic \\(t\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu_0 = 6000\\) hours, \\(n = 5\\), and \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation. First, we calculate the sample standard deviation \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(6000-6680)^2 + (6300-6680)^2 + (6600-6680)^2 + (6700-6680)^2 + (6800-6680)^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(-680)^2 + (-380)^2 + (-80)^2 + 20^2 + 120^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{462400 + 144400 + 6400 + 400 + 14400}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{630000}{4}} = \\sqrt{157500} = 396.87\n   \\]\n   Now, we can calculate the test statistic:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{6680 - 6000}{396.87/\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{680}{396.87/2.236} = \\frac{680}{177.64} \\approx 3.82\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Critical Value:**\n   Since we are performing a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and a sample size of 5, we have 4 degrees of freedom. From the t-distribution table, the critical value for a one-tailed test with 4 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is approximately 2.132.\n\n5. **Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value:**\n   The test statistic \\(t = 3.82\\) is greater than the critical value \\(2.132\\). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   We have sufficient evidence to conclude that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:**\n   The confidence level is \\(1 - 0.05 = 0.95\\) or 95%.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{95}\n\\]",

        "model_output": "To determine if the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation, we will perform a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) is that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has not increased, and the alternative hypothesis \\( H_1 \\) is that the average life has increased.\n\nThe null hypothesis is:\n\\[ H_0: \\theta = 6000 \\]\nThe alternative hypothesis is:\n\\[ H_1: \\theta < 6000 \\]\n\nThe test statistic for the exponential distribution with a sample of size \\( n \\) and observing the first \\( r \\) items fail is given by:\n\\[ T = \\frac{r}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^r x_i \\]\nwhere \\( x_i \\) are the working times of the first \\( r \\) items. Here, \\( r = 5 \\) and \\( n = 20 \\), and the working times are 6000, 6300, 6600, 6700, and 6800. The test statistic \\( T \\) is:\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{20} (6000 + 6300 + 6600 + 6700 + 6800) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 33400 = 8350 \\]\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, \\( T \\) follows a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\( r = 5 \\) and scale parameter \\( \\theta = 6000 \\). The critical value for a one-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05 can be found using the gamma distribution. The critical value \\( c \\) is such that:\n\\[ P(T > c) = 0.05 \\]\n\nUsing the relationship between the gamma distribution and the chi-squared distribution, we can find the critical value. For a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\( k = 5 \\), it is equivalent to a chi-squared distribution with \\( 2k = 10 \\) degrees of freedom, but scaled by \\( 2\\theta = 12000 \\). Therefore, we need to find the chi-squared critical value for 10 degrees of freedom such that:\n\\[ P(\\chi^2 > c') = 0.05 \\]\n\nFrom the chi-squared table, we find that:\n\\[ P(\\chi^2 > 18.307) = 0.05 \\]\n\nThe critical value \\( c \\) for the gamma distribution is:\n\\[ c = \\frac{18.307 \\times 2\\theta}{5} = \\frac{18.307 \\times 12000}{10} = 2196.84 \\]\n\nSince \\( T = 8350 < 21968.4 \\), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation.\n\nTo find the confidence level, we note that the power of the test for a given alternative value \\( \\theta_1 \\) is given by:\n\\[ P(T > c \\mid \\theta = \\theta_1) = P\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^2 x_i > \\frac{5c}{2\\theta} - \\frac{20c}{r}\\right) \\]\n\nHowever, since the power calculation is complex, we use the fact that the test statistic is a sufficient statistic and the critical value is based on the gamma distribution. Therefore, we can use the fact that the power is close to 95% for the given sample size and working times.\n\nThus, the confidence level is:\n\\[ 1 - 0.025 = 95\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the confidence level is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]",
