        "model_output": "To solve the differential equation \\( y^{(5)} - y^{(4)} = 0 \\), we start by finding the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \\( y = e^{rt} \\).

For the root \\( r = 0 \\) with multiplicity 4, the solutions are \\( e^{0t} = 1 \\), \\( t e^{0t} = t \\), \\( t^2 e^{0t} = t^2 \\), and \\( t^3 e^{0t} = t^3 \\). For the root \\( r = 1 \\), the solution is \\( e^{1t} = e^t \\). Therefore, the general solution is:\n\n\\[ y(t) = C_1 + C_2 t + C_3 t^2 + C_4 t^3 + C_5 e^t \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, \\) and \\( C_5 \\) are constants determined by initial conditions.
