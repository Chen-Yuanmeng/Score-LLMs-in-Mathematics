        "model_output": "To solve the differential equation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assume a complementary solution**: We start by assuming that $y = e^{rx}$, where r is a constant. This is known as an exponential solution.\n\n2. **Find the derivatives**: The first derivative of $y$ is $y' = re^{rx}$ and the second derivative of $y$ is $y'' = r^2e^{rx}$.\n\n3. **Substitute into the equation**: We substitute $y$, $y'$, and $y''$ into the differential equation:\n   $$\n   r^2e^{rx} - 3re^{rx} + 2e^{rx} = xe^{2x}\n   $$\n\n4. **Divide by the common factor**: The common factor in the left-hand side is $e^{rx}$. We divide both sides of the equation by this factor:\n   $$\n   r^2 - 3r + 2 = x\n   $$\n\n5. **Recognize the right-hand side as a special function**: We can see that the right-hand side of the equation is $x$, but we should also notice that $xe^{2x}$ is a derivative of a known function. We will use the formula for the derivative of the exponential function to find the general solution of the given equation. We will rewrite the equation in the form:\n   $$\n   r^2 - 3r + 2 = (xe^{2x})'\n   $$\n\n6. **Integrate both sides of the equation**: We integrate both sides with respect to $x$:\n   $$\n   \\int(r^2 - 3r + 2)dx = \\int(xe^{2x})'dx\n   $$\n\n7. **Evaluate the integrals**: Evaluating the integrals, we get:\n   $$\n   \\int(r^2 - 3r + 2)dx = \\int x \\cdot 2e^{2x}dx = \\frac{x^2e^{2x}}{2} - \\frac{xe^{2x}}{2} - \\frac{e^{2x}}{4} + C_1\n   $$\n\n8. **Substitute the integrated function back into the equation**: Now we substitute the integrated function back into the original differential equation and try to solve for the constants in the function.\n\n9. **Subtract the integrated function from the original equation**: We subtract the integrated function from both sides of the equation to get the general solution of the differential equation.\n\n10. **Find the homogeneous solution**: We now assume a homogeneous solution, which will be $y_h = Ae^{rx}$ where r is a root of the characteristic equation and A is a constant.\n\n11. **Find the particular solution**: We now assume a particular solution, which will be $y_p = u(x)e^{2x}$. We now have to find the form of $u(x)$.\n\n12. **Substitute the particular solution into the original equation**: We now substitute $y_p = u(x)e^{2x}$ into the original differential equation and solve for $u(x)$.\n\n13. **Find the form of $u(x)$**: Now we have to find the form of $u(x)$. After substituting the particular solution into the original equation, we get:\n   $$\n   (r^2 - 3r + 2)u(x)e^{2x} = (x + u'(x))e^{2x}\n   $$\n\n   We then equate the coefficients of $e^{2x}$ on both sides of the equation to get:\n   $$\n   r^2 - 3r + 2 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2(r^2 - 3r + 2)u(x) = 2u'(x) + x\n   $$\n\n   We have to find the values of r that satisfy the first equation. Since the first equation is a quadratic equation, we can factor it as:\n   $$\n   (r - 2)(r - 1) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r = 1\n   $$\n\n   Now we substitute the values of r back into the second equation to get:\n   $$\n   2(2 - 3 + 2)u(x) = 2u'(x) + x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2u(x) = 2u'(x) + x\n   $$\n   We now have a first-order differential equation. To solve for $u(x)$, we separate the variables and integrate:\n   $$\n   \\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\int \\frac{dx}{2u(x) - x}\n   $$\n\n   We evaluate the integrals to get:\n   $$\n   \\ln |u| = \\frac{x}{2}\\ln |2u - x| - \\frac{x^2}{4} + C_2\n   $$\n\n   Now we exponentiate both sides of the equation to get:\n   $$\n   u(x) = C_3 \\left(2u - x\\right)^{\\frac{x}{2}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{4}}\n   $$\n\n   We substitute this expression for $u(x)$ back into the particular solution to get:\n   $$\n   y_p = C_3 \\left(2u -
