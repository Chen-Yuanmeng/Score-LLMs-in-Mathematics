In this case, the function is $e^x$, and the antiderivative is also $e^x$.\n\nStep 2: Apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (1) and the lower limit (0), and subtract the two results.\n\nSo, $\\int_{0}^{1} e^x\\mathrm{dx} = e^x|_{0}^{1} = e^1 - e^0 = e - 1$.\n\nStep 3: Use a calculator to find the numerical value of $e$. The mathematical constant $e$ is approximately equal to 2.71828.\n\nSo, $e - 1 \\approx 2.71828 - 1 = 1.71828$.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Final answer: } 1.71828}\n\nRegarding my confidence level, as this is a standard application of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the function involved is quite simple, I am highly confident in my answer.
