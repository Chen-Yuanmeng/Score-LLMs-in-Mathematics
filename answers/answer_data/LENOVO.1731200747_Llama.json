Since $X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4$ are independent of each other and follow a standard normal distribution, we know that $E(X_i) = 0$ and $Var(X_i) = 1$ for $i = 1,2,3,4$.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the random variable $Z = \\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2} } $. We want to find the distribution of $Z$. \n\n3. To do this, let's define $U = X_1-X_2$ and $V = \\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2} $. Then, $Z = \\frac{U}{V}$.\n\n4. Next, we need to find the distribution of $U$ and $V$ separately.\n\n   - Since $X_1,X_2$ are independent standard normal random variables, $U$ is also a standard normal random variable. That is, $U \\sim N(0,1)$.\n   \n   - For $V$, we have $Var(V^2) = Var(X_3^2) + Var(X_4^2) + 2*Cov(X_3^2,X_4^2)$, which is equal to $Var(X_3^2) + Var(X_4^2)$ because $X_3,X_4$ are independent.\n   \n   Since $X_3,X_4$ are standard normal, $Var(X_3^2) = E(X_3^4) - [E(X_3^2)]^2$ and $Var(X_4^2) = E(X_4^4) - [E(X_4^2)]^2$. Now, using the fact that $E(X_i) = 0$ and $Var(X_i) = 1$, it follows that $E(X_i^2) = 1$ and $E(X_i^4) = 3$. Thus, $Var(V^2) = 2 + 2 = 4$. Therefore, $Var(V) = 2$.\n   \n   Hence, $V \\sim N(0,2)$, where we need to divide by $\\sqrt{2}$ to get the variance equal to $2$ for $V$, but here we are finding variance of V squared not V itself, however V does follow from 2 parameters Gamma Distribution.\n5. Using the results from the above steps, $Z = \\frac{U}{V}$. Since $U \\sim N(0,1)$ and $V \\sim N(0,2)$, it can be proved that $\\frac{U}{V}$ follows Cauchy Distribution.\n\nTherefore, the distribution of the random variable $\\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2} } $ is Cauchy.\n\n**Confidence Level: 95%**\n\nNote: The Cauchy Distribution is a continuous probability distribution with a probability density function that has a single parameter, which is the location parameter. However, in this case, since the variance of $V$ is not equal to 1, it follows from 2 parameters Gamma Distribution which is Chi Square distribution, but to maintain the ratio of the variables with standard normal distribution and the variable that is gamma distributed we use Cauchy Distribution.<|eot_id|>",
