The null hypothesis for this test is that the enrollment numbers in each grade level (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).\nH0: The number of students in each grade level follows a discrete uniform distribution.\nH1: The number of students in each grade level does not follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected frequencies for each grade level under the null hypothesis.\nSince the total number of students is 600 and there are 4 grade levels, the expected frequency for each grade level is 600/4 = 150 students.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the chi-square statistic.\nThe chi-square statistic is given by the formula:\n\nχ² = Σ[(O - E)² / E]\n\nwhere O is the observed frequency for each grade level and E is the expected frequency for each grade level.\n\nχ² = [(150 - 150)² / 150] + [(165 - 150)² / 150] + [(145 - 150)² / 150] + [(140 - 150)² / 150]\n\nχ² = 0 + 2.25 + 1.07 + 0.80\n\nχ² = 4.12\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value of the chi-square distribution.\nThe critical value of the chi-square distribution depends on the degrees of freedom and the significance level. The degrees of freedom for this test is the number of grade levels minus 1, which is 3. With a significance level of 0.05, the critical value of the chi-square distribution is 7.815.\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated chi-square statistic with the critical value.\nIf the calculated chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. If it is less than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSince 4.12 < 7.815, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, we do not have enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that the number of students in each grade level follows a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{\\text{The number of students in each grade level follows a discrete uniform distribution.}}\n\nConfidence level: 95% (since the significance level is 0.05)</s>",

In this case, we want to determine if the enrollment numbers of students in each grade follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nHere are the steps to perform the chi-square test:\n\n1. Formulate the null hypothesis:\nThe null hypothesis, H0, states that the data follows a discrete uniform distribution. In this case, the null hypothesis would be:\nH0: The enrollment numbers of students in each grade (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) are the same.\n2. Calculate the expected frequencies:\nThe expected frequencies under the null hypothesis are calculated as follows:\nExpected frequency of freshmen = Expected frequency of sophomores = Expected frequency of juniors = Expected frequency of seniors = (Total number of observations / Number of categories)\n= (600 / 4) = 150\n3. Calculate the chi-square statistic:\nThe chi-square statistic is calculated as follows:\nchi-square = Σ ( (Observed frequency - Expected frequency)^2 / Expected frequency )\n= (150 - 150)^2 / 150 + (165 - 150)^2 / 150 + (145 - 150)^2 / 150 + (140 - 150)^2 / 150\n= 0 + 2.25 + 1.11 + 2.22\n= 5.58\n4. Determine the degrees of freedom:\nThe degrees of freedom for this test are calculated as follows:\nDegrees of freedom = Number of categories - 1\n= 4 - 1\n= 3\n5. Compare the chi-square statistic to the critical value:\nThe critical value for the chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is 7.815.\nSince the chi-square statistic (5.58) is less than the critical value (7.815), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n6. Conclusion:\nBased on the chi-square test, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that the enrollment numbers of students in each grade (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) are not significantly different, and the data supports the hypothesis that the enrollment numbers of students in each grade follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nConfidence level: 95%</s>",
