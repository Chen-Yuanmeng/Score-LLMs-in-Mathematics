        "model_output": " To find the rank of a matrix, we need to reduce the matrix to its echelon form or row-reduced form. This process involves elementary row operations (adding, subtracting, or multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, or swapping two rows) to get the matrix into a standard form. The number of non-zero rows in the echelon form is the rank of the matrix.\n\nStep 1: Identify the leading coefficient of each row. The leading coefficient is the first non-zero element in a row.\n\n- For the first row, the leading coefficient is 1 (from the element (1,1)).\n- For the second row, the leading coefficient is 2 (from the element (2,1)).\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get the leading coefficients in their standard positions (1,0,0,...).\n\n- We can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row to get a new second row: (2,4) - 2*(1,2) = (0,0).\n\nSo, our matrix A now looks like this:\n\n$$ A=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\0 & 0\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nStep 3: Count the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form.\n\nIn our echelon form matrix, we have two non-zero rows. However, the second row is entirely zeros, which means it doesn't contribute to the rank.\n\nSo, the rank of matrix A is 1.\n\n\\boxed{1}\n\nConfidence level: 90%. The process of finding the rank of a matrix is fairly straightforward and well-defined, but there's always a chance for a mistake in calculation or misunderstanding of the steps.</s>",
