Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. \n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\n$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $f'(x) = 0$. \n\nSo, we set $f'(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$4x^3 - 12x^2 = 0$\n\nThis can be simplified by factoring out a $4x^2$:\n\n$4x^2(x - 3) = 0$\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions $x = 0$ and $x = 3$. \n\nSo, the critical points of the function are $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether these critical points are minima, maxima, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of the function.\n\nThe second derivative of the function $f(x)$ is:\n\n$f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\n$f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 24(0) = 0$\n\n$f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) = 36$\n\nSince $f''(0) = 0$, the second derivative test is inconclusive for $x = 0$. However, we can see that $f''(3) = 36 > 0$. Therefore, the function has a local minimum at $x = 3$.\n\nFinally, we need to check the endpoints of the domain of the function, if applicable. Since the function is a polynomial, the domain is all real numbers. Therefore, we don't need to check the endpoints.\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$ is $f(3) = 3^4 - 4(3^3) + 10 = 81 - 108 + 10 = 23$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{23}$.
