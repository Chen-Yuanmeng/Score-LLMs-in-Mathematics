        "model_output": " Step 1: Identify the pattern in the series. The series is an alternating series where the terms alternate in sign and the power of x increases by 1 in each term.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for the sum of an alternating series. The sum of an alternating series is given by the formula: $S = a_1 + \\frac{a_2}{2} + \\frac{a_3}{3} + ... + \\frac{a_n}{n} + ...$, where $a_n$ is the nth term of the series.\n\nStep 3: Apply the formula to the given series. The first term $a_1$ is $\\frac{-x^3}{3}$, the second term $a_2$ is $\\frac{x^5}{5}$, the third term $a_3$ is $\\frac{-x^7}{7}$, and so on. Substituting these into the formula gives:\n\n$S = \\frac{-x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{2*5} - \\frac{x^7}{3*7} + ... + \\frac{(-1)^n \\cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} + ...$\n\nStep 4: Notice that the terms in the denominator of each fraction are the odd numbers, which are also the denominators of the fractions in the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$.\n\nStep 5: Recall the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$. The Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$ is given by the formula: $tan^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x}{1} - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{x^7}{7} + ... + \\frac{(-1)^{n-1} x^{2n-1}}{2n-1} + ...$\n\nStep 6: Compare the given series with the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$. The given series has the same form as the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$, but with a negative sign in front of each term after the first term.\n\nStep 7: Modify the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$ to match the given series. To match the given series, we can multiply the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$ by $-1$ and add $\\frac{x}{2}$. This gives:\n\n$S = -(\\frac{x}{1} - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{x^7}{7} + ... + \\frac{(-1)^{n-1} x^{2n-1}}{2n-1} + ...) + \\frac{x}{2}$\n\n$S = \\frac{-x}{2} + \\frac{x}{1} - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{x^7}{7} + ... + \\frac{(-1)^{n-1} x^{2n-1}}{2n-1} + ...$\n\nStep 8: Simplify the expression for S. The first two terms in the expression for S simplify to $\\frac{x}{2}$. The remaining terms form the Taylor series expansion of $tan^{-1}(x)$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$S = \\frac{x}{2} + tan^{-1}(-x)$\n\nStep 9: Express the answer in terms of a single function. We can express the answer in terms of a single function by using the identity $tan^{-1}(x) + tan^{-1}(-x) = 0$. This gives:\n\n$S = \\frac{x}{2} - tan^{-1}(x)$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the given power series is $\\boxed{\\frac{x}{2} - tan^{-1}(x)}$.\n\nMy confidence level in this answer is 100%. The steps are based on the rules of series summation and the Taylor series expansion of the arctangent function. The final answer is a direct result of these steps and does not require any further assumptions or approximations.</s>",
