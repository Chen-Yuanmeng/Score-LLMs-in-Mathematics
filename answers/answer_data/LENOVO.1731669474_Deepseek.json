The antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{x}$ with respect to $x$ is $\\ln|x|$. \n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{x} \\mathrm{dx} = \\ln|x| + C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\ln|x| + C}$.\n\nNow, let's give our confidence in percentage level. As an AI language model, I am unable to directly calculate the confidence level, but I can provide some insight into the problem. This type of integral is a basic one that can be solved by recognizing that the derivative of the natural logarithm function is $\\frac{1}{x}$. Therefore, the antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{x}$ is $\\ln|x|$. \n\nThe confidence level in this answer would depend on the level of understanding of the natural logarithm function and its properties by the person asking the question. If they have a good understanding of the natural logarithm function and its properties, they should be able to recognize that $\\ln|x|$ is the antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{x}$. So, I would estimate the confidence level to be around 80% or higher.",
