Therefore, the magnitude of angle A is the same as the magnitude of angle B and angle C. \n\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, the magnitude of each angle in an equilateral triangle is 180/3 = 60 degrees. \n\nSo, the magnitude of angle A is $\\boxed{60}$ degrees.\n\nMy confidence in this answer is $\\boxed{100\\%}$.",
