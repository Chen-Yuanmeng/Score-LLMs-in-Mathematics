        "model_output": " Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step:\n\n1. We have three equations:\n   - x + y + z = 6\n   - x - y + 2z = 5\n   - 3x - y - z = -2\n\n2. First, let's add the second and third equations to eliminate y:\n   - (x - y + 2z) + (3x - y - z) = 5 + (-2)\n   - 4x + z = 3\n\n3. Now, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:\n   - (x - y + 2z) - (x + y + z) = 5 - 6\n   - y + z = -1\n\n4. From the third equation, we can express y in terms of x and z:\n   - y = 3x - z\n\n5. Now, substitute y = 3x - z into the equation y + z = -1:\n   - 3x - z + z = -1\n   - 3x = -1\n   - x = -1/3\n\n6. Substitute x = -1/3 into the first equation to find y:\n   - (-1/3) + y + z = 6\n   - y + z = 6 + 1/3\n   - y + z = 19/3\n\n7. Since y = 3x - z, we can substitute x = -1/3 and y + z = 19/3 into this equation:\n   - y = 3(-1/3) - z\n   - y = -1 - z\n   - -1 - z + z = 19/3\n   - z = 22/3\n\n8. Finally, substitute z = 22/3 into y + z = 19/3 to find y:\n   - y + 22/3 = 19/3\n   - y = 19/3 - 22/3\n   - y = -3/3\n   - y = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = -1/3, y = -1, and z = 22/3.\n\nAs for the confidence level, I'm about 80% confident in this answer, as I've followed the standard method of solving a system of linear equations using substitution and elimination. However, this answer is based on my understanding and the accuracy of my calculations. If there's any part of the process you'd like me to explain further, feel free to ask!\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{x = -\\frac{1}{3}, y = -1, z = \\frac{22}{3}}$.</s>",

We have the system of equations:\n   x + y + z = 6\n   x - y + 2z = 5\n   3x - y - z = -2\n\n2. We can start by eliminating one variable. Let's eliminate 'y' from the second equation and the third equation. We can do this by adding the first equation to the second equation and then subtracting the third equation from the first equation. This gives us:\n\n   x + 3z = 11\n   -x + 2z = -8\n\n3. Now, we can add these two equations together to solve for 'z'. This gives us:\n\n   5z = 3\n   z = 3/5\n\n4. Now that we have 'z', we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for 'x' and 'y'. This gives us:\n\n   x + y + 3/5 = 6\n   x + y = 27/5\n\n5. We can solve for 'x' and 'y' by using the second equation and the equation we just found. This gives us:\n\n   x - y + 2*(3/5) = 5\n   x - y = 17/5\n\n6. Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find 'x' and 'y'. Adding the two equations together gives us:\n\n   2x = 44/5\n   x = 22/5\n\n7. Substituting 'x' back into the equation x + y = 27/5 gives us:\n\n   22/5 + y = 27/5\n   y = 5/5\n   y = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 22/5\ny = 1\nz = 3/5\n\nI am 100% confident in this answer.</s>",
