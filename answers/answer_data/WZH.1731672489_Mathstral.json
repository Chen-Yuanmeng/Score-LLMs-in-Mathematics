Here, 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2, confirming that it is a right triangle.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the hypotenuse\nSince it's a right triangle, the hypotenuse (side with length 10) is the diameter of the circumscribed circle.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the radius\nThe radius of a circle is half the length of the diameter. So, we need to divide the length of the hypotenuse by 2:\n\nRadius = Hypotenuse / 2\nRadius = 10 / 2\nRadius = 5\n\nFinal answer: The radius of the circumscribed circle is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nConfidence level: 100% (This problem can be easily solved by recognizing it as a right triangle and using the properties of the circumscribed circle.)</s>",
