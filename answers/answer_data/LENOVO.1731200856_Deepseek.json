The K-S test compares the empirical distribution function of the data to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the chosen distribution (in this case, the standard normal distribution). \n\nFirst, let's sort the samples in ascending order:\n-1.87, -1.24, -1.22, -1.10, -0.68, 0.08, 1.21, 1.28, 1.35\n\nNext, we need to calculate the empirical CDF values at the sorted data points. We can do this by calculating the rank of each data point and then normalizing it by the total number of data points.\n\n-1.87: rank = 1, ECDF = 1/10 = 0.1\n-1.24: rank = 2, ECDF = 2/10 = 0.2\n-1.22: rank = 3, ECDF = 3/10 = 0.3\n-1.10: rank = 4, ECDF = 4/10 = 0.4\n-0.68: rank = 5, ECDF = 5/10 = 0.5\n0.08: rank = 6, ECDF = 6/10 = 0.6\n1.21: rank = 7, ECDF = 7/10 = 0.7\n1.28: rank = 8, ECDF = 8/10 = 0.8\n1.35: rank = 9, ECDF = 9/10 = 0.9\n\nNow, we need to calculate the CDF values at these points for the standard normal distribution using the standard normal CDF table or a calculator.\n\n-1.87: CDF = 0.0359\n-1.24: CDF = 0.1075\n-1.22: CDF = 0.1112\n-1.10: CDF = 0.1357\n-0.68: CDF = 0.2483\n0.08: CDF = 0.5319\n1.21: CDF = 0.8869\n1.28: CDF = 0.8997\n1.35: CDF = 0.9147\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute differences between the ECDF and CDF values:\n\n-1.87: |0.1 - 0.0359| = 0.0641\n-1.24: |0.2 - 0.1075| = 0.0925\n-1.22: |0.3 - 0.1112| = 0.1888\n-1.10: |0.4 - 0.1357| = 0.2643\n-0.68: |0.5 - 0.2483| = 0.2517\n0.08: |0.6 - 0.5319| = 0.0681\n1.21: |0.7 - 0.8869| = 0.1869\n1.28: |0.8 - 0.8997| = 0.0997\n1.35: |0.9 - 0.9147| = 0.0147\n\nFinally, we find the maximum absolute difference (D) between the ECDF and CDF values:\n\nD = max(0.0641, 0.0925, 0.1888, 0.2643, 0.2517, 0.0681, 0.1869, 0.0997, 0.0147) = 0.2643\n\nNow, we need to compare this D value with the critical value for the K-S test at the 0.05 significance level. For a sample size of 10, the critical value is approximately 0.41.\n\nSince D = 0.2643 < 0.41, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that the given samples are not significantly different from a standard normal distribution at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the K-S test is a non-parametric test, which means it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data. Therefore, even though we fail to reject the null hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean that the samples are from a standard normal distribution. It is always a good idea to visualize the data and check for normality using other techniques like histograms and Q-Q plots.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is $\\boxed{False}$, and the confidence in this answer is $\\boxed{60\\%}$. This is because while the K-S test shows that the samples are not significantly different from a standard normal distribution at the 0.05 significance level, it does not provide definitive evidence of normality. Visualization and other normality tests should be used to confirm the findings.",
