This will allow us to apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem, which states that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above, then it converges to a finite limit.\n\nStep 3:  To show that the sequence $(a_n)$ is increasing, we can take two consecutive terms $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$, and show that $a_{n+1} > a_n$. \n\nStep 4:  For the sequence $(a_n)$, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na_n &= (1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n \\\\\na_{n+1} &= (1+\\frac{1}{n+1} )^{n+1}\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 5:  Taking the ratio of $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} &= \\frac{(1+\\frac{1}{n+1} )^{n+1}}{(1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(1+\\frac{1}{n+1} )^{n+1}}{(1+\\frac{1}{n} )^{n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{(1+\\frac{1}{n} )^{n+1}}{(1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n} \\\\\n&= (1+\\frac{1}{n+1} ) \\cdot (1+\\frac{1}{n} ) \\\\\n&> 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 6:  This shows that the sequence $(a_n)$ is increasing.\n\nStep 7:  To show that the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded above, we can observe that for any $n$, $1+\\frac{1}{n} < 2$.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, we can conclude that the sequence $(a_n)$ is increasing and bounded above.\n\nStep 9:  Applying the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we can conclude that the sequence $(a_n)$ converges to a finite limit as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nStep 10:  To find the limit, we can let $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n$.\n\nStep 11:  Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ln L &= \\ln \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln ((1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\ln (1+\\frac{1}{n} )\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 12:  Using the Taylor series expansion of $\\ln(1+x)$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ln(1+\\frac{1}{n} ) &= \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2n^2} + \\frac{1}{3n^3} - \\ldots \\\\\nn \\ln (1+\\frac{1}{n} ) &= 1 - \\frac{1}{2n} + \\frac{1}{3n^2} - \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 13:  Taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\ln (1+\\frac{1}{n} ) &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{2n} + \\frac{1}{3n^2} - \\ldots) \\\\\n&= 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, we can conclude that $\\ln L = 1$, which implies that $L = e^1 = e$.\n\n\\boxed{L = e}\n\nConfidence Level: 100%<|eot_id|>",
