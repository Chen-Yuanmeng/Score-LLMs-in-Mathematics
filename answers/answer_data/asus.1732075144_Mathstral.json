The exponential distribution is often used to model the time until an event occurs in a constant rate process.\n\nThe variance of an exponentially distributed random variable X with rate parameter λ is given by the formula:\n\n$var(X) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}$\n\nIn this case, λ = 2. So, we substitute λ into the formula:\n\n$var(X) = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSo, the variance of X is 1/4.\n\nRegarding my confidence, I'm 100% confident in this answer as it directly follows from the properties of the exponential distribution and the given rate parameter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ with a confidence level of 100%.</s>",
