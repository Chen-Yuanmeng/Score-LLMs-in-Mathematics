So, $1533{\\div} 73 = 21$.\n\n2. **Addition**: Next, we perform the addition operation. We take the result from the division and add $159$. So, $21 + 159 = 180$.\n\n3. **Subtraction**: Lastly, we perform the subtraction operation. We subtract $57$ from the result of the addition. So, $180 - 57 = 123$.\n\nSo, the final answer to $1533{\\div} 73+  159- 57$ is $\\boxed{123}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I'm quite confident in my answer. The operations involved were straightforward and didn't require any estimations or complex calculations. Therefore, I'd say my confidence level is about $\\boxed{95\\%}$.</s>",
