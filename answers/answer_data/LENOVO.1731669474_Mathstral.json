This is a standard result in calculus and is covered in introductory calculus courses. Therefore, I am confident that this is correct. However, I would estimate my confidence level at 90%. This is because while this result is widely known and understood, there is always a chance that there could be some nuance or context I'm not aware of that might affect the answer.</s>",

This is a standard form of an integral, and we know that the antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{x}$ is $\\ln|x|$.\n\n2. **Apply the antiderivative**: So, we apply the antiderivative to both sides of the equation. This gives us $\\int \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln|x| + C$.\n\n3. **Add the constant of integration**: Remember, when we take the antiderivative of a function, we always add the constant of integration $C$ to account for all possible functions that could have been differentiated to get our original function.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\ln|x| + C}$.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I'm 100% confident in this answer because I'm just using a standard rule for integrals and applying it correctly.
