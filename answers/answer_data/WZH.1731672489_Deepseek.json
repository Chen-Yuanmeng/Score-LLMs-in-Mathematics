        "model_output": " The circumscribed circle of a triangle is a circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. The radius of this circle can be found using the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4A}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and $A$ is the area of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the triangle. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle, which states that the area of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, defined as $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = 6$, $b = 8$, and $c = 10$. So, the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{6+8+10}{2} = 12$.\n\nUsing Heron's formula, the area of the triangle is $A = \\sqrt{12(12-6)(12-8)(12-10)} = \\sqrt{12 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2} = \\sqrt{144} = 12$ square units.\n\nNow we can find the radius of the circumscribed circle using the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4A}$. Substituting the given values, we get $R = \\frac{6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10}{4 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{480}{48} = 10$ units.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circumscribed circle is $\\boxed{10}$ units.\n\nI am $\\boxed{100\\%}$ confident in my answer.",
