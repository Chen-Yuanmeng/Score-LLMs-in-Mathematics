Substituting $x = 4$ into the function $f(x) = x^2$, we get:\n\n$f(4) = 4^2 = 16$\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$. The derivative of $x^2$ with respect to $x$ is $2x$. So, substituting $x = 4$ into the derivative, we get:\n\n$f'(4) = 2(4) = 8$\n\nNow, we can substitute $f(4) = 16$, $f'(4) = 8$, and $a = 4$ into the formula for the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - 16 = 8(x - 4)$\n\nSolving this equation for $y$, we get:\n\n$y = 8(x - 4) + 16 = 8x - 32 + 16 = 8x - 16$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the function $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 4$ is $y = 8x - 16$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the confidence in the answer.
