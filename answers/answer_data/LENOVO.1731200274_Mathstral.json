Since $\\frac{1}{x}$ approaches negative infinity, the function $f(x)$ also approaches negative infinity. Therefore, the vertical asymptote is at $x = 0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n\n2. **As $x \\to \\infty$:**\n\nWe can rewrite the function $f(x)$ as follows:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + \\ln\\left(e^{x} + 1\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + x\\left(\\ln\\left(e^{x} + 1\\right) - x\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + x\\left(\\frac{e^{x} - e^{x} + 1}{e^{x} + 1} - x\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + x\\left(\\frac{-e^{x} + 1}{e^{x} + 1}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{x(-e^{x} + 1)}{e^{x} + 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{-xe^{x} + x}{e^{x} + 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{-x}{e^{x} + 1} + \\frac{x}{x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{-x}{e^{x} + 1} + 1\n\\]\n\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{x} \\to 0$, and $\\frac{-x}{e^{x} + 1} \\to 0$ because the exponential term $e^{x}$ grows much faster than $x$. Therefore, the function $f(x)$ approaches $1$. This indicates that the horizontal asymptote is $y = 1$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} + \\ln{(e^{x} + 1)}$ has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and a horizontal asymptote at $y = 1$ as $x \\to \\infty$.

The reciprocal function has a vertical asymptote at x=0 (as the denominator becomes zero), and the natural logarithm function has a horizontal asymptote at y=0 (as the input to the logarithm becomes very large).\n\nStep 2: Find the vertical asymptote.\nThe vertical asymptote is given by the value of x that makes the denominator of the reciprocal function zero. In this case, it's x=0.\n\nStep 3: Find the horizontal asymptote.\nThe horizontal asymptote is determined by the degree and leading coefficients of the polynomial in the numerator and denominator of the function. However, in this case, the function is not a rational function (does not have a polynomial in the numerator), so we cannot use this method.\n\nInstead, we can observe that as x approaches positive or negative infinity, the term e^x in the natural logarithm function dominates, making ln(e^x + 1) approach x. So, the horizontal asymptote is y=x.\n\nSo, the asymptotes of the function are x=0 (vertical) and y=x (horizontal).\n\nConfidence level: 95%. I used standard methods for finding asymptotes and made sure to check for both vertical and horizontal asymptotes. However, I had to make an assumption about the horizontal asymptote due to the nature of the function, which could potentially lead to a mistake.</s>",
