However, the exact confidence level is not typically associated with this theoretical result in the context of probability distributions. Instead, we often use the t-distribution to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, where the specific confidence level is chosen based on the problem at hand. For the purpose of this problem, we can say that our answer is correct with a confidence level of \\(100\\%\\), as it is a theoretical result that holds exactly under the given assumptions.",
