        "model_output": "When two straight lines are parallel, the corresponding angles formed by a transversal line are equal. This is a fundamental property of parallel lines.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Definition of Parallel Lines**: Two lines are parallel if they lie in the same plane and never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.\n\n2. **Transversal Line**: A transversal is a line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points.\n\n3. **Corresponding Angles**: When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are the angles that are in the same relative position at each intersection. For example, if the transversal intersects the parallel lines at points A and B, and we label the angles formed at point A as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and at point B as 5, 6, 7, and 8, then the corresponding angles are 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8.\n\n4. **Property of Corresponding Angles**: The property states that corresponding angles are equal. So, if angle 1 is equal to angle 5, angle 2 is equal to angle 6, angle 3 is equal to angle 7, and angle 4 is equal to angle 8.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the isotoping angles of two parallel lines is that they are equal.
