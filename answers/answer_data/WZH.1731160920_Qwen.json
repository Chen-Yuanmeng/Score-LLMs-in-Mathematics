        "model_output": "To determine which three of the center of gravity, vertical center, inner center, and outer center of a general triangle are always collinear, we need to understand the definitions and properties of these points.\n\n1. **Center of Gravity (Centroid)**: The center of gravity of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.\n\n2. **Vertical Center**: This term is not a standard geometric term for a triangle. It might be referring to the orthocenter, which is the point where the three altitudes of the triangle intersect. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n3. **Inner Center**: This term is not a standard geometric term for a triangle. It might be referring to the incenter, which is the point where the three angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. The incenter is the center of the triangle's inscribed circle (incircle), which is the circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.\n\n4. **Outer Center**: This term is not a standard geometric term for a triangle. It might be referring to the circumcenter, which is the point where the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect. The circumcenter is the center of the triangle's circumscribed circle (circumcircle), which is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle.\n\nGiven these definitions, the three points that are always collinear in any triangle are the centroid (center of gravity), the circumcenter, and the orthocenter. This line is known as the Euler line.\n\nTherefore, the three points that are always collinear are the centroid, the circumcenter, and the orthocenter. The confidence level regarding this answer is 100%.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",
