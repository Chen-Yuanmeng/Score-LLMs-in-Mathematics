        "model_output": " To solve the inequality $x^2-5x+6<0$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the quadratic equation**: The given inequality is a quadratic equation that can be factored. Factoring $x^2-5x+6$, we get $(x-2)(x-3)$.\n\n2. **Find the intervals where the inequality holds**: The factored form of the inequality is $(x-2)(x-3)<0$. This inequality holds true in the intervals where the product of $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$ is negative. This happens when one of the factors is positive and the other is negative.\n\n3. **Determine the critical points**: The critical points are the values of $x$ that make each factor equal to zero. For $(x-2)(x-3)<0$, the critical points are $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\n4. **Test intervals for sign**: We now test the intervals determined by the critical points to see where the inequality holds.\n   - For $x<2$, both $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$ are negative, so their product is positive. This does not satisfy the inequality.\n   - For $2<x<3$, $(x-2)$ is positive and $(x-3)$ is negative, so their product is negative. This satisfies the inequality.\n   - For $x>3$, both $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$ are positive, so their product is positive. This does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n5. **Write the solution set**: From the test intervals, we find that the solution set is $2<x<3$.\n\nSo, the solution set of the inequality $x^2-5x+6<0$ is $\\boxed{2<x<3}$.\n\nRegarding your confidence level, I would give it a high level of confidence, as the steps provided are standard for solving quadratic inequalities, and the solution is consistent with the mathematical principles.</s>",
