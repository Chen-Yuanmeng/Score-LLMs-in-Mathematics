In this case, $a=7$, $b=8$, and $c=9$. So, $s = \\frac{7+8+9}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$.\n\nThe area of the triangle can be found using Heron's formula: $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$. Substituting the values, we get $A = \\sqrt{12(12-7)(12-8)(12-9)} = \\sqrt{12*5*4*3} = \\sqrt{720} = 6\\sqrt{20} = 6*2\\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle (also known as the inradius) is given by the formula: $r = \\frac{A}{s}$.

We used Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle and the formula for the inradius to find the radius of the inscribed circle. These formulas are well-established and widely used in geometry, so we are confident in our answer. Our confidence level is $\\boxed{90\\%}$.",
