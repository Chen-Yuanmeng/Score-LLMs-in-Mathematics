First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. In this case, the operations involved are addition, subtraction, and division. So, we start with division: $4.45 \\div 3.2 = 1.4$.\n\n3. Now, we substitute this result back into the original expression: $9.8 - 7.6 + 1.4$.\n\n4. Next, we perform subtraction: $9.8 - 7.6 = 2.2$.\n\n5.
