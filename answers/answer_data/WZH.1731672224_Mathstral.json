        "model_output": " Sure, let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to recall the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as: a² + b² = c², where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n2. In this case, we are given that the lengths of the two right-angled sides are 3 and 4. So, we can substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem to get: 3² + 4² = c².\n\n3. Next, we calculate the squares of 3 and 4. This gives us: 9 + 16 = c².\n\n4. Then, we add these two values together: 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n5. Finally, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find the length of the hypotenuse: √25 = 5.\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I am quite confident about this answer, as it directly follows from the Pythagorean theorem and the calculations are straightforward. I would say my confidence level is about 95%.\n\nFinal answer: The length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{5}$ units.</s>",
