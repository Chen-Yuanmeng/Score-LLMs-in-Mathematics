Use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the point of tangency and $m$ is the slope. Substituting the values we found, we get $y-16=8(x-4)$.\n5. Simplify the equation to get it in the form $y=mx+b$. Distributing the 8, we get $y-16=8x-32$. Adding 16 to both sides, we get $y=8x-16$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent line to the function $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=4$ is:\n\n\\boxed{y=8x-16}\n\nI am 99% confident in this answer.<|eot_id|>",
