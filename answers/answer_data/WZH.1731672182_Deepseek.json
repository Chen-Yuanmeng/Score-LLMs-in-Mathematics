        "model_output": " The sum of the inside angles of a convex octagon can be found using the formula:\n\nSum of angles = (n-2) * 180°\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.

I am very confident in this answer because I used a formula that is universally applicable to all convex polygons. If you apply the formula to any other polygon, you will always get the correct answer. The formula is derived from the fact that a polygon can be divided into (n-2) triangles, and the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°.",
