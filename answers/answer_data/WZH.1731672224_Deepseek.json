        "model_output": " This is a special case of the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nHere, the lengths of the two sides are 3 and 4. So, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the length of the hypotenuse as $c$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2$\n\n$c^2 = 9 + 16$\n\n$c^2 = 25$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to solve for $c$, we get:\n\n$c = \\sqrt{25}$\n\n$c = 5$\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nNow, let's check the confidence level. I am confident in this answer because it is based on the Pythagorean theorem, which is a well-established and widely-used mathematical principle. Moreover, the result matches the known Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5), which further strengthens my confidence. So, my confidence level in this answer is $\\boxed{95\\%}$.",
