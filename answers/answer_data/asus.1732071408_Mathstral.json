        "occurrence": 3,
        "model_output": " Sure, let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand that division by zero is undefined in mathematics. So, we can't directly calculate $0 \\div 998$. However, in this case, we have a zero before the division sign, which effectively makes the entire expression zero because any number multiplied by zero is zero. So, $0 \\div 998 = 0$.\n\n2. Now, we subtract $998$ from the result we got from the division, which is $0$. So, $0 - 998 = -998$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{-998}$.\n\nAs for my confidence in this answer, it's quite high. I used standard mathematical rules and principles to arrive at this conclusion, and there are no apparent contradictions or errors in the calculation. I would rate my confidence at approximately 95%.</s>",
