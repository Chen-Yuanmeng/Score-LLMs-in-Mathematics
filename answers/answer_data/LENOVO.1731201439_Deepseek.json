This is because the t-distribution has a non-zero probability of taking on extreme values, particularly when the degrees of freedom $n$ is small. This property of the t-distribution means that the expected value, which is the average value of the distribution, does not exist as a finite number. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{not defined}$.
