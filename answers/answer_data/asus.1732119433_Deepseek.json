        "model_output": " We can rewrite the given differential equation as ${y}^{(4)}({y} - 1) = 0$.\nFrom this, we have two cases:\n1. ${y}^{(4)} = 0$\n2. ${y} - 1 = 0$\n\nFor the first case, we have ${y}^{(4)} = 0$. This implies that the fourth derivative of $y$ is constant. The general solution for this case is $y(x) = Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4$, where $A, B, C, D$ are constants.\n\nFor the second case, we have $y = 1$. This is a constant function, and the general solution for this case is $y(x) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the general solution of the given differential equation is $y(x) = Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4$ or $y(x) = 1$.\n\nSince the problem is relatively straightforward, we are very confident in our answer.
