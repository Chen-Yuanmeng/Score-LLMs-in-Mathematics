State the null and alternative hypotheses:\n   H0: The number of students in each year follows a discrete uniform distribution.\n   H1: The number of students in each year does not follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\n2. Determine the significance level (α) and the degree of freedom (k):\n   α = 0.05\n   There are k = 4 different categories (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors) - 1 = 3 degrees of freedom.\n\n3. Create a table of observed and expected frequencies:\n   To calculate the expected frequencies, we divide the total sample size (600) by the number of categories (4).\n   The expected frequency for each category is: 600/4 = 150\n\n   | Category  | Observed Frequency  | Expected Frequency |\n   |  ---      |  -----------------  |  -----------------  |\n   |  Freshmen | 150                 | 150                 |\n   |  Sophomores | 165                | 150                 |\n   |  Juniors   | 145                 | 150                 |\n   |  Seniors   | 140                 | 150                 |\n\n4. Calculate the chi-square statistic:\n   The formula for the chi-square statistic is:\n   χ² = Σ [(observed frequency - expected frequency)^2 / expected frequency]\n   \n   Calculating the chi-square statistic for each category:\n   χ²_freshmen = [(150 - 150)^2 / 150] = 0\n   χ²_sophomores = [(165 - 150)^2 / 150] = 1.8\n   χ²_juniors = [(145 - 150)^2 / 150] = 0.83\n   χ²_seniors = [(140 - 150)^2 / 150] = 2\n\n   The sum of these values is the chi-square statistic:\n   χ² = 0 + 1.8 + 0.83 + 2 = 4.63\n\n5. Determine the critical value or p-value:\n   We compare the calculated chi-square statistic (4.63) to the critical value from the chi-square distribution table with 3 degrees of freedom and α = 0.05.\n   The critical value is approximately 7.81.\n\n   Alternatively, we can calculate the p-value associated with the chi-square statistic. However, given the format, we'll proceed with the critical value method for this problem.\n\n6. Make a decision:\n   Since the calculated chi-square statistic (4.63) is less than the critical value (7.81), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the number of students in each year appears to follow a discrete uniform distribution at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nConfidence level: 80%\n\nNote: This is a relatively low-confidence level due to the fact that we simplified the p-value calculation and the problem does not allow for us to compute the actual p-value. The p-value gives us a more accurate measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis, which is the discrete uniform distribution. If we could compute the p-value, we would get a more precise answer.<|eot_id|>",
