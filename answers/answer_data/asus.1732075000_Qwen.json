        "question_in_English": "To investigate whether the enrollment numbers of a particular major at a university over four consecutive years are comparable. A random sample of 600 students from this major at the university was taken, and it was found that there were 150 freshmen, 165 sophomores, 145 juniors, and 140 seniors. With a significance level of 0.05, does the number of students in each grade follow a discrete uniform distribution?",

        "model_output": "To determine if the number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution, we can use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Here are the steps to perform this test:\n\n1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses:**\n   - \\(H_0\\): The number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution.\n   - \\(H_a\\): The number of students in each grade does not follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\n2. **Determine the expected frequencies:**\n   If the distribution is uniform, each grade should have the same number of students. Since there are 600 students and 4 grades, the expected frequency for each grade is:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{600}{4} = 150\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the observed frequencies:**\n   The observed frequencies are given as:\n   - Freshmen: 150\n   - Sophomores: 165\n   - Juniors: 145\n   - Seniors: 140\n\n4. **Compute the chi-square test statistic:**\n   The chi-square test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}\n   \\]\n   where \\(O\\) is the observed frequency and \\(E\\) is the expected frequency. Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\chi^2 = \\frac{(150 - 150)^2}{150} + \\frac{(165 - 150)^2}{150} + \\frac{(145 - 150)^2}{150} + \\frac{(140 - 150)^2}{150}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\chi^2 = \\frac{0^2}{150} + \\frac{15^2}{150} + \\frac{(-5)^2}{150} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{150} = 0 + \\frac{225}{150} + \\frac{25}{150} + \\frac{100}{150} = 0 + 1.5 + \\frac{5}{30} + \\frac{20}{30} = 1.5 + \\frac{5}{15} + \\frac{20}{15} = 1.5 + \\frac{25}{15} = 1.5 + \\frac{5}{3} = 1.5 + 1.6667 = 3.1667\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the degrees of freedom:**\n   The degrees of freedom for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test is \\(k - 1\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of categories. Here, \\(k = 4\\), so:\n   \\[\n   df = 4 - 1 = 3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the critical value:**\n   Using a chi-square distribution table with \\(df = 3\\) and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 7.815.\n\n7. **Compare the test statistic to the critical value:**\n   Since the calculated chi-square test statistic (3.1667) is less than the critical value (7.815), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n8. **State the conclusion:**\n   At a significance level of 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the number of students in each grade does not follow a discrete uniform distribution. Therefore, we conclude that the number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution.\n\n9. ** confidence level:**\n   Since we fail to reject the null hypothesis, our confidence level is the complement of the significance level. Thus, the confidence level is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.05 = 0.95 = 95\\%\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{95}\n\\]",
