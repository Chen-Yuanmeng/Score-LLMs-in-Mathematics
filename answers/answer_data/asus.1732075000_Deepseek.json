        "question_in_English": "To investigate whether the enrollment numbers of a particular major at a university over four consecutive years are comparable. A random sample of 600 students from this major at the university was taken, and it was found that there were 150 freshmen, 165 sophomores, 145 juniors, and 140 seniors. With a significance level of 0.05, does the number of students in each grade follow a discrete uniform distribution?",

        "model_output": " To determine whether the number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution, we can perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. First, let's calculate the expected number of students in each grade under the discrete uniform distribution.\n\nSince there are 600 students and 4 grades, the expected number of students in each grade is 600 / 4 = 150.\n\nNow, we can set up a chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05. The null hypothesis is that the number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution, and the alternative hypothesis is that the distribution is not uniform.\n\nWe can calculate the chi-square test statistic using the formula:\n\nχ² = Σ[(observed - expected)² / expected]\n\nFor freshmen:\nχ² = (150 - 150)² / 150 = 0\n\nFor sophomores:\nχ² = (165 - 150)² / 150 = 2.25\n\nFor juniors:\nχ² = (145 - 150)² / 150 = 0.25\n\nFor seniors:\nχ² = (140 - 150)² / 150 = 0.67\n\nNow, we sum up the chi-square test statistic:\n\nχ² = 0 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.67 = 3.17\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value for the chi-square distribution with a significance level of 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom (number of grades - 1). Using a chi-square table or calculator, we find the critical value to be 7.815.\n\nSince our calculated chi-square test statistic (3.17) is less than the critical value (7.815), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, at a significance level of 0.05, we cannot conclude that the number of students in each grade does not follow a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{True}$.\n\nHowever, I am 90% confident in my answer, as my calculations and reasoning suggest that the number of students in each grade follows a discrete uniform distribution.",
