        "model_output": " To calculate the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1+\\frac{1}{n} )^n$, we can use the method of substitution. Let's define $x = \\frac{1}{n}$. As $n$ approaches infinity, $x$ approaches $0$. So, we can rewrite the limit as:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}$$\n\nNow, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$$\\ln \\left[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\right] = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\ln (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}$$\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we can simplify the right side:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{x}$$\n\nThis limit is of the form $\\frac{0}{0}$, so we can use L'Hôpital's rule. According to L'Hôpital's rule, if the limit of a function as x approaches a certain value is of the form $\\frac{0}{0}$ or $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$, then the limit of that function is equal to the limit of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator as x approaches the same value.\n\nSo, we need to find the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator. The derivative of the numerator, $\\ln(1+x)$, is $\\frac{1}{1+x}$, and the derivative of the denominator, $x$, is $1$. Therefore, the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+x}}{1}$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{1}{1+x}$$\n\nNow, as $x$ approaches $0$, the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1+0} = 1$$\n\nSince the original limit was the natural logarithm of the new limit, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$$\\ln \\left[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\right] = 1$$\n\nFinally, we can take the exponential of both sides to find the limit:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} = e^1 = e$$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{e}$. My confidence in this answer is 100%.",
