It is named after the mathematician Gabriel Cramer, who first introduced the concept in 1750. The Vantmont determinant is used to solve systems of linear equations.\n\nHowever, the term \"Vantmont determinant\" is not actually used in mathematics. The correct term is \"Cramer's rule,\" which states that the value of each variable in a system of linear equations can be found by dividing the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the column of the coefficient matrix with the constants by the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n| a  b |\n| c  d |\n```\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n\n```\nad - bc\n```\n\nIf you provide the values of a, b, c, and d, we can calculate the determinant for you.\n\nConfidence: 95%",
