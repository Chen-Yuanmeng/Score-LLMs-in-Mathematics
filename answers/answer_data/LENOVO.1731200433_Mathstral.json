First, we need to understand that the second-order mixed partial derivative is the partial derivative of the first partial derivative. In other words, it's the derivative of the derivative.\n\n2. The first step is to find the first partial derivative of the function $f(x,y)=x^y$ with respect to $y$. The derivative of $x^y$ with respect to $y$ is $x^y \\ln(x)$ (using the chain rule).\n\n3. The next step is to find the derivative of this result with respect to $x$. The derivative of $x^y \\ln(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $x^{y-1} \\ln(x) + x^{y-1}$ (again using the chain rule).\n\n4. Now, we need to evaluate this derivative at the point (1,4). Substituting $x=1$ and $y=4$ into the derivative gives us $(1)^{4-1} \\ln(1) + (1)^{4-1} = 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, the second-order mixed partial derivative of the function $f(x,y)=x^y$ at the point (1,4) is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nAs for the confidence level, it's hard to give a precise percentage, but I would say I'm around 90% confident in this answer. This is based on the rules of differentiation being correctly applied, and the calculations being correct. However, without being able to check my work or have a larger context to understand the problem, it's hard to be more precise.</s>",
