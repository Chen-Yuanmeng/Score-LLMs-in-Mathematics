The expression is $0{\\div} 998- 998$. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we can start with the division.\n\n2. In division, we divide the numbers. $0{\\div} 998$ is $0$ because any number divided by $0$ is undefined, but we are getting 0 here since the dividend is 0, so we can proceed with this part of the expression as 0.\n\n3. Now, we subtract $998$ from $0$. $0- 998 = -998$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{-998}$. I am 100% confident in my answer.<|eot_id|>",
