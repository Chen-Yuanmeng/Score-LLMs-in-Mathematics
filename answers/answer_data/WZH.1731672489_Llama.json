Given sides 6, 8 and 10 which can be seen as 3-4-5 right triangle times 2.\n\n1. Find semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle: \n   s = (a + b + c) / 2 \n   s = (6 + 8 + 10) / 2 \n   s = 24 / 2 \n   s = 12 \n\n2. Since it is a right triangle, the diameter of the circumscribed circle is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.\n   So, the radius will be half the length of the hypotenuse.\n   Therefore, R = 10 / 2\n   R = 5\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circumscribed circle is 5.\n\nConfidence Level: 90%<|eot_id|>",
