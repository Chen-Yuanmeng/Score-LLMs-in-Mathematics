The Alternating Series Test states that if a series alternates between positive and negative terms, and if the absolute value of the terms decreases monotonically towards 0, then the series converges.\n\nLet's verify the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Alternating Series**: The series alternates between positive and negative terms since $\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ takes the value of $\\frac{1}{n}$ when $n$ is odd and $-\\frac{1}{n}$ when $n$ is even.\n\n2. **Decreasing Absolute Value of Terms**: The absolute value of the $n$-th term is $\\frac{1}{n}$, which is greater than the absolute value of the $(n+1)$-th term, $\\frac{1}{n+1}$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $\\frac{1}{n}$ will always be greater than $\\frac{1}{n+1}$. This shows that the absolute value of the terms is strictly decreasing.\n\n3. **Tending to Zero**: As $n$ approaches infinity, $\\frac{1}{n}$ approaches 0. This shows that the absolute value of the terms is also approaching 0.\n\nSince all three conditions of the Alternating Series Test are met, we can conclude that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{(-1)^n}{n} $ converges.\n\n**Confidence Level**: I am 100% confident in my answer.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{The series converges.}}$</s>",
