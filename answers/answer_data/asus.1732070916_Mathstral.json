So, the expression becomes $6 + (-3) \\div 3 \\times \\sqrt{4}$.\n2. Next, we handle the division and multiplication part from left to right. The square root of 4 is 2, so we have $6 + (-3) \\div 3 \\times 2$. Now, we perform the division: $-3 \\div 3 = -1$. So, the expression becomes $6 - 1 \\times 2$.\n3. Then, we perform the multiplication: $-1 \\times 2 = -2$. So, the expression becomes $6 - 2$.\n4. Finally, we perform the subtraction: $6 - 2 = 4$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nRegarding my confidence in the answer, I'm 100% confident in my answer. I've followed the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) correctly, and there are no special rules or functions involved in this problem that might cause a mistake.</s>",
