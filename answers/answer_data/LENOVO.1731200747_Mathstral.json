Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have four independent random variables, $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$, each following a standard normal distribution. We're asked to find the distribution of the random variable $\\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}}$.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Problem**: The numerator, $X_1-X_2$, is the difference of two independent standard normal random variables. The denominator, $\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}$, is the magnitude of the sum of two independent standard normal random variables.\n\n3. **Applying Relevant Theorems**: According to the Rice's theorem, the distribution of $X_1 - X_2$ is a standard normal distribution. The magnitude of the sum of two independent standard normal random variables, $\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}$, is known to have a chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.\n\n4. **Concluding the Distribution**: The ratio of a standard normal distribution (the numerator) and a chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (the denominator) results in a Cauchy distribution. This is because the ratio of a normal random variable and the absolute value of another normal random variable follows a Cauchy distribution.\n\nSo, the random variable $\\frac{X_1-X_2}{\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}}$ follows a Cauchy distribution.\n\nAs for my confidence level, I would say it's high, given that the solution follows directly from the application of Rice's theorem and the properties of the Cauchy distribution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Cauchy Distribution}}\n\nWith a confidence level of 95%.</s>",

The numerator of the given random variable, $X_1-X_2$, is the difference of two independent standard normal variables. The distribution of this difference is a symmetric distribution centered at 0, but it is not a standard normal distribution. In fact, it is a difference of two normal random variables, and its distribution can be calculated using convolution, but it is not straightforward.\n\n3. The denominator of the given random variable, $\\sqrt{X_3^2+X_4^2}$, is the sum of squares of two independent standard normal variables. This is a form of a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.\n\n4. The distribution of the ratio of a normal variable and a chi-squared variable is a form of a t-distribution. However, in this case, the numerator is not a standard normal variable, so we cannot directly apply the t-distribution.\n\n5. Therefore, the distribution of the given random variable is not a standard normal distribution, a t-distribution, or a chi-squared distribution. It is a more complex distribution that results from the convolution of the numerator's distribution with the denominator's distribution.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The distribution of the given random variable is not a standard normal distribution, a t-distribution, or a chi-squared distribution.
