This is an infinite series where each term is a fraction with a constant numerator (6) and a denominator that is the square of a natural number multiplied by $\\pi^2$.\n\nThis series is actually a form of a special type of series known as a Riemann Zeta Series. Specifically, it's the series for $\\zeta(2)$ multiplied by $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$. The Riemann Zeta Function, $\\zeta(s)$, is defined as the sum of the infinite series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^s}$.\n\nFor $s = 2$, $\\zeta(2) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$.\n\nSo, the given series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{6}{\\pi^2n^2}$ is actually $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2} \\times \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} = 1$.\n\n\\boxed{1}\n\nRegarding the confidence level, I'm an AI language model trained on a diverse range of text and code, and my responses are based on the information I've been trained on.

The Basel problem is to find the sum of the infinite series of reciprocals of the squares of natural numbers, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^2}$. The Basel problem was first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735.\n\nThe solution to the Basel problem is $\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$. This means that the sum of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n^2}$ is equal to $\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$.\n\nIn your case, the series is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{6}{\\pi^2n^2}$. This is essentially the Basel problem series multiplied by $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$.\n\nSo, to find the sum of your series, you can multiply the sum of the Basel problem series by $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$.\n\nSum of your series = Sum of Basel problem series * $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$\n\n= $\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$ * $\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the sum of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{6}{\\pi^2n^2}$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nAs for the confidence level, I'm a language model AI, not a mathematician, but I'm 95% confident that my answer is correct based on the mathematical knowledge I've been trained on.</s>",
