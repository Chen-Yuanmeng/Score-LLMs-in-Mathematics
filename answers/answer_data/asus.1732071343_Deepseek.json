        "model_output": " To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $\\sqrt[3]{27}$.\nThe cube root of 27 is the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives 27. In this case, that number is 3 because $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$. So, $\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate $1+ \\frac{2}{3}$.\nTo add 1 and $\\frac{2}{3}$, we need to convert 1 into a fraction with a denominator of 3. We know that 1 is the same as $\\frac{3}{3}$, so $1+ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2.\nNow that we have the results from Step 1 and Step 2, we can multiply them together. \n\nSo, $\\sqrt[3]{27} \\times \\left ( 1+  \\frac{2}{3}  \\right ) = 3 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.
