This is a division operation, and the result is $21$.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to calculate $159 - 57$. This is a subtraction operation, and the result is $102$.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we need to calculate $21 + 102$. This is an addition operation, and the result is $123$.\n\nSo, $1533{\\div} 73+  159- 57 = \\boxed{123}$.\n\nAs for the confidence level, I am very confident in my answer because I followed the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) correctly and used basic arithmetic operations correctly.",
