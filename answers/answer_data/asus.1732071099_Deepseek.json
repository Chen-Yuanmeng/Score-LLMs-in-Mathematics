The expression is $\\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{7}{4 + \\cfrac{9}{3}}}$. \n\nThe first step is to simplify the innermost fraction, which is $\\cfrac{9}{3}$. The fraction simplifies to $3$. \n\nSo, the expression becomes $\\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{7}{4 + 3}}$. \n\nNext, simplify the fraction in the denominator of the second fraction, which is $\\cfrac{7}{4 + 3}$. The expression inside the denominator simplifies to $7/7$, which equals $1$. \n\nSo, the expression becomes $\\cfrac{1}{6 + 1}$. \n\nNext, simplify the expression in the denominator, which is $6 + 1$.
