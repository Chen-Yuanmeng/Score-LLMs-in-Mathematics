In this case, we have 5 + 4 = 9.\n\n```\n8765\n+3214\n------\n  9\n```\n\nStep 3: Move one position to the left. Now we have 6 + 1 = 7, but we also need to consider the carry from the previous step (9). So, the actual calculation is 6 + 1 + 9 = 16. The result is 16, and we write 6 (ignoring the extra 10 we need to write down).\n\n```\n8765\n+3214\n------\n  6\n```\n\nStep 4: Move one position to the left. Now we have 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n```\n8765\n+3214\n------\n  69\n```\n\nStep 5: Move one position to the left. Now we have 8 + 3 = 11, but we also need to consider the carry from the previous step (9). So, the actual calculation is 8 + 3 + 9 = 20. The result is 20, and we write 0 and carry over the 2.\n\n```\n8765\n+3214\n------\n  209\n```\n\nNow we have no more positions to move. We simply add the remaining carry.\n\n```\n8765\n+3214\n------\n  209\n```\n\nSince we only had one carry left, the final answer remains the same.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11979}$\n\nI am 100% confident regarding my answer.<|eot_id|>",

Add the first digit (the only remaining number 0 is now in the hundred thousands place and is multiplied by 10 and then added with 1): 1 + 0*10 = 1.\n\nNow, we combine 40 and 1 to get the final result: 40479.\n\nTherefore, the result of the calculation is: \n\\boxed{40479}.\n\nConfidence level: 100% (Since the calculation involves simple addition and no complex operations, the result is accurate and there's no room for error.)<|eot_id|>",
