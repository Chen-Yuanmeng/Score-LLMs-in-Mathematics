The number $9999$ is larger than $4567$, so we don't have to worry about any borrowing or negative numbers.\n\nHere's how it looks:\n\n```\n  9999\n- 4567\n```\n\nNow, we subtract each column from right to left.\n\nIn the rightmost column, we have $9 - 7 = 2$.\n\nIn the second column, we have $9 - 6 = 3$.\n\nIn the third column, we have $9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nIn the leftmost column, we have $9 - 4 = 5$.\n\nSo, the answer is $5432$.\n\nNow, let's give our confidence in the percentage level. We are very confident in our answer because we followed the standard procedure for subtraction, which always works.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{5432}$ and our confidence level is $\\boxed{100\\%}$.",
