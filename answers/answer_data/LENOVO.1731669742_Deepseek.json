        "model_output": " To solve the inequality $x^2-5x+6<0$, we first need to find the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2-5x+6=0$. We can do this by factoring the equation:\n\n$x^2-5x+6 = (x-2)(x-3)$.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\nNext, we plot these roots on a number line. Since the quadratic equation is in the form $(x-a)(x-b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the roots, the parabola opens upwards if $a<b$ and opens downwards if $a>b$. In this case, $a=2$ and $b=3$, so the parabola opens upwards.\n\nWe know that the quadratic is less than zero when it is below the x-axis. This happens between the roots $x=2$ and $x=3$. So, the solution to the inequality $x^2-5x+6<0$ is $x \\in (2,3)$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{(2,3)}$. We are confident in this answer because we found the roots of the quadratic equation and determined the range of values for $x$ that satisfy the inequality.",

        "model_output": " We can solve this inequality by factoring the quadratic expression. The quadratic expression $x^2-5x+6$ can be factored into $(x-2)(x-3)$. So, the inequality becomes $(x-2)(x-3)<0$.\n\nThe expression $(x-2)(x-3)$ changes sign at $x=2$ and $x=3$. Therefore, we need to test the sign of $(x-2)(x-3)$ in the intervals $(-\\infty, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, \\infty)$.\n\n1. For $x<2$, both $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$ are negative, so their product is positive. Therefore, $(x-2)(x-3)<0$ is not true for $x<2$.\n\n2. For $2<x<3$, $(x-2)$ is positive and $(x-3)$ is negative, so their product is negative. Therefore, $(x-2)(x-3)<0$ is true for $2<x<3$.\n\n3. For $x>3$, both $(x-2)$ and $(x-3)$ are positive, so their product is positive. Therefore, $(x-2)(x-3)<0$ is not true for $x>3$.\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality $(x-2)(x-3)<0$ is $2<x<3$.
