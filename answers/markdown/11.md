**Question in English**: Calculate $\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}}$ , express the result in fractional form.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the expression, we need to evaluate the denominator from the innermost fraction to the outermost fraction.



Step 1: Evaluate the innermost fraction, which is $\cfrac{9}{3}$. 



$\cfrac{9}{3} = 3$



Step 2: Now, evaluate the next fraction, which is $\cfrac{7}{4 + 3}$.



$\cfrac{7}{4 + 3} = \cfrac{7}{7} = 1$



Step 3: Now, evaluate the next fraction, which is $6 + 1$.



$6 + 1 = 7$



Step 4: Now, we can rewrite the original expression as $\cfrac{1}{7}$.





We need to express $\cfrac{1}{7}$ as a fraction that cannot be simplified further. Since 1 and 7 are relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), we cannot simplify this fraction further. Therefore, the result is already in its simplest form.





\boxed{$\cfrac{1}{7}$}

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations and evaluate the expression step by step.



1. Start with the innermost fraction:

   $\cfrac{9}{3} = 3$



2. Now the expression becomes $\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + 3}}$



3. Next, evaluate the next level of nested fractions:

   $\cfrac{7}{4 + 3} = \cfrac{7}{7} = 1$



4. Now the expression becomes $\cfrac{1}{6 + 1}$



5. Next, add the numbers in the denominator:

   $6 + 1 = 7$



6. Now the expression becomes $\cfrac{1}{7}$



Therefore, the result is $\boxed{\cfrac{1}{7}}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 计算$\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}}$ ,结果以分数形式表示.

**Question in English**: Calculate $\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}}$ , express the result in fractional form.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the given expression $\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}}$, we will start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.



Step 1:

Innermost part: $4 + \cfrac{9}{3}$

To calculate this, we need to convert the fraction $\cfrac{9}{3}$ to a decimal or a fraction with the same denominator. In this case, we'll keep it as a fraction.



$\cfrac{9}{3} = \cfrac{9 \times 1}{3 \times 1} = \cfrac{9}{3}$



Now, we can add 4 to this fraction by finding a common denominator.



$4 = \cfrac{4 \times 3}{3 \times 1} = \cfrac{12}{3}$



Now, we can add the two fractions together:



$4 + \cfrac{9}{3} = \cfrac{12}{3} + \cfrac{9}{3} = \cfrac{12 + 9}{3} = \cfrac{21}{3}$



Step 2:

Now, we can calculate the next part of the expression, which is $\cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}$.



We already know that $4 + \cfrac{9}{3} = \cfrac{21}{3}$, so we can substitute this into the expression.



$\cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}} = \cfrac{7}{\cfrac{21}{3}}$



To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by the reciprocal.



$\cfrac{7}{\cfrac{21}{3}} = 7 \times \cfrac{3}{21} = \cfrac{7 \times 3}{21} = \cfrac{21}{21} = 1$



Step 3:

Now, we can calculate the final part of the expression, which is $\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}}$.



We already know that $\cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}} = 1$, so we can substitute this into the expression.



$\cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{7}{4 + \cfrac{9}{3}}} = \cfrac{1}{6 + 1} = \cfrac{1}{7}$



Therefore, the result of the expression is $\boxed{\cfrac{1}{7}}$.

**Question in English**: Calculate $1533{\div} 73+  159- 57$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the expression $1533{\div} 73+  159- 57$, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):



1. Divide 1533 by 73: 

   $1533{\div} 73 = 21.000...$



We'll keep the result as a decimal for now.



2. Add 159 to the result:

   $21.000... + 159 = 180.000...$



3. Subtract 57 from the result:

   $180.000... - 57 = 123.000...$



Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 123. 



So, $\boxed{123}.$

**Question in English**: Calculate $1533{\div} 73+  159- 57$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the expression $1533{\div} 73+  159- 57$, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):



1. Divide $1533$ by $73$:

   $1533{\div} 73 = 21.02739726027451$



2. Now, we have $21.02739726027451 + 159 - 57$. To simplify this, we can first add and subtract the whole numbers:

   $159 - 57 = 102$



3. Now, we have $21.02739726027451 + 102$. 

   $21.02739726027451 + 102 = 123.02739726027451$



4. Since we need a final answer and assuming that it should be a decimal, our answer is $123.02739726027451$. However, as the problem does not explicitly state the format for the answer, we can simplify it to $123.03$ if we want a more precise representation of the decimal answer.

To calculate the variance of an exponential distribution, we can use the following formula:



$var(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$



where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.



Given that $X\sim Exp(2)$, we know that $\lambda = 2$.



Substituting the value of $\lambda$ into the formula, we get:



$var(X) = \frac{1}{2^2}$

$var(X) = \frac{1}{4}$



Therefore,



$\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$

To calculate the variance of an exponential distribution, we can use the formula:



var(X) = σ^2



For an exponential distribution, the variance is equal to the square of the rate parameter (λ). 



Given that X ~ Exp(2), we can identify the rate parameter (λ) as 2. 



Now, we can plug in the value of λ into the formula:



var(X) = (2)^2

       = 4



Therefore,

**Question in Chinese**: 计算微分方程的通解${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Question in English**: Calculate the general solution of the differential equation ${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the general solution of the differential equation, we need to find the characteristic equation and solve for its roots.



Step 1: Write down the characteristic equation by substituting $y = e^{rt}$ into the differential equation.



$y^{(5)} - y^{(4)} = r^5e^{rt} - r^4e^{rt} = 0$



Divide both sides by $e^{rt}$ to get the characteristic equation:



$r^5 - r^4 = 0$



Step 2: Factor out $r^4$ from the equation:



$r^4(r-1) = 0$



Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero to find the roots of the characteristic equation:



$r^4 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 0$



$r - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 1$



Step 4: Since we have a repeated root, the general solution will be:



$y = c_1e^{0t} + c_2te^{0t} + c_3t^2e^{0t} + c_4te^{t} + c_5e^{t}$



Simplify the expression to get:



$y = c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2 + c_4te^{t} + c_5e^{t}$



The final answer is: $\boxed{y = c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2 + c_4te^{t} + c_5e^{t}}$

**Question in Chinese**: 计算微分方程的通解${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Question in English**: Calculate the general solution of the differential equation ${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the general solution of the differential equation, we'll first find the characteristic equation.



Given differential equation: 

${y}^{(5)} - {y}^{(4)} = 0$



Let's assume y = e^(rx) is a solution of the differential equation.



Substitute y = e^(rx) into the given differential equation:

r^5e^(rx) - r^4e^(rx) = 0



Since e^(rx) cannot be equal to 0, we can divide by e^(rx) to get:

r^5 - r^4 = 0



Now, let's factor out r^4 from both terms:

r^4(r - 1) = 0



We have a product of two factors that equals 0, so either r^4 = 0 or (r - 1) = 0.



For r^4 = 0:

r = 0 (this is a repeated root with multiplicity 4)



For (r - 1) = 0:

r = 1



The characteristic equation has the roots 0 (with multiplicity 4) and 1. 



The general solution of a homogeneous differential equation is a linear combination of solutions formed by each root (with the same multiplicity as the root). 



Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation y^(5) - y^(4) = 0 is:

y = c1e^(0x) + c2xe^(0x) + c3x^2e^(0x) + c4x^3e^(0x) + c5e^(x)



Since c1x^i*e^(0x) = c1x^i, the general solution simplifies to:



y = c1 + c2x + c3x^2 + c4x^3 + c5e^(x)



where c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are arbitrary constants.

**Question in Chinese**: 计算微分方程的通解${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Question in English**: Calculate the general solution of the differential equation ${y}^{(5)} -{y}^{(4)} =0$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this differential equation, we will use the method of solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients.



Step 1: Let's assume that the solution has the form $y = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a constant and $t$ is the independent variable.



Step 2: Now, we will find the derivatives of $y$ up to the fifth order:

- $y' = re^{rt}$

- $y'' = r^2e^{rt}$

- $y''' = r^3e^{rt}$

- $y^{(4)} = r^4e^{rt}$

- $y^{(5)} = r^5e^{rt}$



Step 3: Now we will substitute $y$ and its derivatives into the original differential equation:



$r^5e^{rt} - r^4e^{rt} = 0$



Step 4: Cancel out the common factor $e^{rt}$ from both terms, we get:



$r^5 - r^4 = 0$



Step 5: Factor out $r^4$ from both terms, we get:



$r^4(r - 1) = 0$



Step 6: Now we will find the roots of the equation:



$r^4 = 0$ and $r - 1 = 0$



Step 7: Solve for $r$ in each equation:

- $r^4 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 0$ (four solutions: $r = 0, 0, 0, 0$)

- $r - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow r = 1$



Step 8: Since we have four repeated roots and one distinct root, the general solution is:



$y = c_1e^{0t} + c_2te^{0t} + c_3t^2e^{0t} + c_4t^3e^{0t} + c_5e^{t}$



Simplifying the equation, we get:



$y = c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2 + c_4t^3 + c_5e^{t}$



Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation is:



\boxed{$y = c_1 + c_2t + c_3t^2 + c_4t^3 + c_5e^{t}$}

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n}$, we'll first break down the sum into two separate sums:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$



Now, let's evaluate each sum separately:



**Sum 1: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n}$**



To evaluate this sum, we can use the property of geometric series. We can rewrite the sum as:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} = 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n}$



Now, let's try to evaluate this sum by using a familiar technique.



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} = S$



We can multiply both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$:



$\frac{1}{2}S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^{n+1}}$



Now, let's subtract the two equations:



$S - \frac{1}{2}S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^{n+1}}$



Simplifying, we get:



$\frac{1}{2}S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^{n+1}} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty } \frac{n-1}{2^n}$



Using a similar trick as before, we can rewrite the sum as:



$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty } \frac{n-1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=2}^{\infty } \frac{n-1}{2^{n-1}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} - 1 \right)$



Substituting this back into our original equation, we get:



$\frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2} \left( S - 1 \right)$



Solving for $S$, we get:



$S = 2$



Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} = 2$



Substituting this back into our original equation, we get:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$



**Sum 2: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$**



This is a geometric series with first term $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and common ratio $r = \frac{1}{2}$.



The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } ar^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r}$



Substituting $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $r = \frac{1}{2}$, we get:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 1$



Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = 4 - 1 = 3$.



So, our answer is $\boxed{3}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the given infinite series, we'll first break it down into two separate series and then find the sum of each individual series. 



Let's consider the given series: 



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n}$



We can rewrite this as: 



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \left( \frac{2n}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^n} \right)$



Now, let's break this down into two separate series:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$



For the first series, let's find its sum by considering it as a derivative of a geometric series. 



Consider the geometric series: 



$S(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty } x^n$



Differentiating with respect to x:



$\frac{dS}{dx} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } n x^{n-1}$



Multiplying by x:



$x \frac{dS}{dx} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } n x^n$



Setting $x = \frac{1}{2}$, we get:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\left( 1-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = 2$



Now, let's multiply the above series by 2 to get:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} = 4$



Now, let's focus on the second series:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$



This is a geometric series with first term $a_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ and common ratio $r = \frac{1}{2}$. 



The sum of the infinite geometric series is given by:



$S = \frac{a_1}{1-r}$



Substituting the values:



$S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 1$



Now, let's combine the results of the two series:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = 4 - 1 = \boxed{3}$

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the given problem, let's start by breaking down the series into two separate series:



$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$.



Now, let's solve each series individually.



For the first series, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n}$, we can rewrite it as:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} = 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n}$.



Now, we can use a standard technique to evaluate this series. Let's consider the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}$, valid for |x| < 1. Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } nx^{n-1} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$.



Multiplying both sides by x, we get:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } nx^{n} = \frac{x}{(1-x)^2}$.



Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the equation above:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } n\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = 2$.



So, we have: $2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{n}{2^n} = 2(2) = 4$.



For the second series, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$, we can see that it's a geometric series with first term $\frac{1}{2}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } ar^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r}$.



In this case, a = $\frac{1}{2}$ and r = $\frac{1}{2}$. So, the sum of the series is:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 1$.



Now, we can substitute the values we found for both series back into the original equation:

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n-1}{2^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{2n}{2^n} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = 4 - 1 = 3$.



Therefore, the sum of the series is: $\boxed{3}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 求幂级数的和函数: $ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $。

**Question in English**: Find the sum function of a power series:$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the sum function of the given power series, we first recognize the pattern of the series:



$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $$



The series resembles an alternating series, where the sign changes at each term due to the presence of $(-1)^n$. 



We can expand the first few terms of the series to identify a pattern:



$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} = -x^3 - \frac{x^5}{3} + \frac{x^7}{5} - \frac{x^9}{7} + \ldots $$



By observing the series, we can identify a known function whose power series expansion resembles this pattern:



The series can be represented as the power series expansion of the function: $-\tan^{-1}(x)$. We can deduce this by comparing the power series with the known expansion of $\tan^{-1}(x)$.



The power series expansion of $\tan^{-1}(x)$ is given by: $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$. By comparing this with our series, we can see that the power series expansion of $-\tan^{-1}(x)$ is given by:



$-\tan^{-1}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$



Therefore, the sum function of the given power series is:



$-\tan^{-1}(x)$



Confidence level: 95%



Reasoning:



The above steps involve comparing the given series with the known power series expansion of the function $\tan^{-1}(x)$. By matching the pattern of the series with the known expansion, we can confidently conclude that the sum function of the given power series is indeed $-\tan^{-1}(x)$. 



However, it is essential to note that the power series expansion of $\tan^{-1}(x)$ converges for $|x| \leq 1$, which is a crucial constraint on the domain of the sum function.<|eot_id|>

**Question in Chinese**: 求幂级数的和函数: $ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $。

**Question in English**: Find the sum function of a power series:$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the sum function of the power series, we first need to identify the type of series it is. 



Given: $ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $



This power series has the following characteristics:



- The general term is $a_n = \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$

- The term is alternating since $(-1)^n$ is an alternating sign.

- The degree of the power of x in each term is increasing linearly by 2.

- It is not an even function since it has odd powers of x.



We notice that the given power series resembles the Taylor series for $\arcsin(x)$ around $x = 0$.



Now we recall the Taylor series for $\arcsin(x)$:



$\arcsin(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$.



Since our power series has the same form as the Taylor series for $\arcsin(x)$, we can conclude that the sum function is $\arcsin(x)$.



Therefore, the sum function of the power series is $\boxed{\arcsin(x)}$.

**Question in English**: Find the sum function of a power series:$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the sum function of the power series, we first need to recognize the pattern of the series. The series has the form:



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$$



This can be rewritten as:



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n} \cdot x}{2n+1}$$



Now, let's introduce a new variable $t = x^2$. Then, we can rewrite the series as:



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot t^n \cdot x}{2n+1}$$



This is a power series of the form:



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } a_n \cdot t^n$$



where $a_n = \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x}{2n+1}$.



To find the sum function of the series, we need to find a function $f(t)$ such that:



$$f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } a_n \cdot t^n$$



In this case, we can recognize that the series is related to the Taylor series expansion of the inverse tangent function. Specifically, we have:



$$f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot t^n}{2n+1} = - \tan^{-1}(t)$$



Now, we need to substitute back $x^2$ for $t$ and simplify:



$$f(x^2) = - \tan^{-1}(x^2)$$



Finally, we can rewrite the sum function in terms of $x$:



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n \cdot x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} = - x \tan^{-1}(x^2)$$



So, the sum function of the power series is $- x \tan^{-1}(x^2)$.

**Question in Chinese**: 计算多重积分:$\iiint_{V} xyz\mathrm{d}V ,V=\left \{ (x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1,x\ge 0,y\ge 0,z\ge 0 \right \}   $。

**Question in English**: Compute the multiple integral:$\iiint_{V} xyz\mathrm{d}V ,V=\left \{ (x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1,x\ge 0,y\ge 0,z\ge 0 \right \}   $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To compute the multiple integral, we need to use spherical coordinates. The region V is a quarter of a unit sphere in the first octant.



1. Convert the region V to spherical coordinates:



- $ x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta $

- $ y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta $

- $ z = \rho \cos \phi $



where $ \rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 1 $, $ 0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} $, and $ 0 \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} $.



2. The volume element dV is given by:



$ \mathrm{d}V = \rho^2 \sin \phi \mathrm{d} \rho \mathrm{d} \phi \mathrm{d} \theta $



3. The function to integrate is:



$ xyz = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta \cdot \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta \cdot \rho \cos \phi = \rho^3 \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta $



4. Now we can write the integral:



$ \iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{1} \rho^3 \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \rho^2 \sin \phi \mathrm{d} \rho \mathrm{d} \phi \mathrm{d} \theta $



5. Evaluate the integral with respect to $ \rho $:



$ \int_{0}^{1} \rho^5 \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \sin \phi \mathrm{d} \rho = \frac{1}{6} \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \mathrm{d} \phi \mathrm{d} \theta $



6. Evaluate the integral with respect to $ \theta $:



$ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{6} \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \mathrm{d} \theta = \frac{1}{24} \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d} \phi $



7. Evaluate the integral with respect to $ \phi $:



$ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{24} \sin^2 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d} \phi = \frac{1}{192} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d} \phi $



To evaluate the integral of $ \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi $, we can use integration by parts:



$ \int \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d} \phi = -\frac{\sin^4 \phi}{4} + \frac{\sin^2 \phi}{2} $



$ = \left[ -\frac{\sin^4 \phi}{4} + \frac{\sin^2 \phi}{2} \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} $



Therefore:



$ \iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \frac{1}{192} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{768} $



\boxed{$\frac{1}{768}$}

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we need to convert the given integral into spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the conversion formulas are:



$x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta$

$y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta$

$z = \rho \cos \phi$



The region $V$ is the first octant of the unit sphere, which can be described in spherical coordinates as:



$0 \le \rho \le 1$

$0 \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$

$0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}$



The Jacobian for the transformation to spherical coordinates is $\rho^2 \sin \phi$. The integral becomes:



$\iiint_V xyz\mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{1} (\rho \sin \phi \cos \theta)(\rho \sin \phi \sin \theta)(\rho \cos \phi) \rho^2 \sin \phi \mathrm{d}\rho \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Now we can simplify and evaluate the integral:



$\iiint_V xyz\mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{1} \rho^4 \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \mathrm{d}\rho \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Splitting the integral into separate parts:



$\iiint_V xyz\mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos \theta \sin \theta \mathrm{d}\theta \int_{0}^{1} \rho^4 \mathrm{d}\rho \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d}\phi$



Evaluating each of these integrals separately:



$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos \theta \sin \theta \mathrm{d}\theta = \left[ \frac{1}{2} \sin^2 \theta \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}$



$\int_{0}^{1} \rho^4 \mathrm{d}\rho = \left[ \frac{\rho^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}$



$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^3 \phi \cos \phi \mathrm{d}\phi = \left[ -\frac{\sin^4 \phi}{4} \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{4}$



Combining these results, we get:



$\iiint_V xyz\mathrm{d}V = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{40}$



Therefore,



\boxed{$\frac{1}{40}$}

**Question in Chinese**: 计算多重积分:$\iiint_{V} xyz\mathrm{d}V ,V=\left \{ (x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1,x\ge 0,y\ge 0,z\ge 0 \right \}   $。

**Question in English**: Compute the multiple integral:$\iiint_{V} xyz\mathrm{d}V ,V=\left \{ (x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^2\le 1,x\ge 0,y\ge 0,z\ge 0 \right \}   $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To compute the multiple integral $\iiint_{V} xyz\mathrm{d}V$, we need to first define the region of integration $V$. This region is a quarter of a unit sphere with the positive octant, where $x \ge 0, y \ge 0, z \ge 0$. 



First, let's convert the given integral to spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ where:

- $x = r \sin(\phi) \cos(\theta)$

- $y = r \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta)$

- $z = r \cos(\phi)$

- $\mathrm{d}V = r^2 \sin(\phi) \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}\theta \mathrm{d}\phi$

- $V = \left \{ (r,\theta,\phi):0 \le r \le 1, 0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \right \}$



Now, we can rewrite the integral in spherical coordinates:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{1} (r \sin(\phi) \cos(\theta))(r \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta))(r \cos(\phi))r^2 \sin(\phi) \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Expanding and simplifying the integrand, we have:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{1} r^4 \sin^3(\phi) \cos(\phi) \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Evaluating the innermost integral, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left[ \frac{r^5}{5} \sin^3(\phi) \cos(\phi) \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \right]_{0}^{1} \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Simplifying, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{5} \sin^3(\phi) \cos(\phi) \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\theta$



Now, evaluating the integral with respect to $\phi$, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \frac{1}{5} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \left[ -\frac{\cos^2(\phi)}{2} \right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \mathrm{d}\theta$



Simplifying, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = -\frac{1}{10} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \mathrm{d}\theta$



Now, evaluating the integral with respect to $\theta$, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = -\frac{1}{10} \left[ \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2} \right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}$



Simplifying, we get:



$\iiint_{V} xyz \mathrm{d}V = \frac{1}{20}$



Therefore, the final answer is:



\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}

**Question in English**: A set of observations $(x,y): (-0.72,-0.061),(0.88,1.55),(-1.94,-0.97),(-0.87,-0.42),(0.083,0.55),(0.54,0.93),(-0.71,-0.23),(- 2.55,-1.61),(1.98,2.02),(0.54,0.73)$, and the random error term follows a normal distribution with unknown variance.Test the significance of the regression coefficients of the empirical linear regression equation $\widehat{y}=0.476+0.818x$ at the significance level $\alpha=0.05$ to determine whether $X$ has a significant effect on $Y$ or not.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To test the significance of the regression coefficients, we need to perform an F-test. The F-statistic is calculated as follows:



1. First, we calculate the sum of squares for the regression (SSR), the sum of squares for the error (SSE), and the total sum of squares (SST).



- Calculate the mean of x and y: 

$\overline{x} = \frac{-0.72+0.88-1.94-0.87+0.083+0.54-0.71-2.55+1.98+0.54}{10} = -0.335$

$\overline{y} = \frac{-0.061+1.55-0.97-0.42+0.55+0.93-0.23-1.61+2.02+0.73}{10} = 0.479$



- Now, let's calculate the deviations from the mean and the slope of the regression line.



| x | y | x - $\overline{x}$ | y - $\overline{y}$ | (x - $\overline{x}$)^2 | (y - $\overline{y}$)^2 | (y - $\overline{y}$)(x - $\overline{x}$) |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| -0.72 | -0.061 | -0.35 | -0.54 | 0.1225 | 0.2916 | 0.1854 |

| 0.88 | 1.55 | 1.20 | 1.07 | 1.44 | 1.1449 | 1.284 |

| -1.94 | -0.97 | -2.26 | -1.09 | 5.0996 | 1.1881 | 2.374 |

| -0.87 | -0.42 | -0.55 | -0.64 | 0.3025 | 0.4096 | 0.412 |

| 0.083 | 0.55 | 0.40 | 0.07 | 0.16 | 0.0049 | 0.0048 |

| 0.54 | 0.93 | 0.59 | 0.45 | 0.3481 | 0.2025 | 0.204 |

| -0.71 | -0.23 | -0.69 | -0.46 | 0.4761 | 0.2116 | 0.313 |

| -2.55 | -1.61 | -2.82 | -1.13 | 7.9364 | 1.2789 | 2.567 |

| 1.98 | 2.02 | 2.33 | 0.54 | 5.4289 | 0.2916 | 0.918 |



- Next, calculate the slope (b) and intercept (a) of the regression line.



The slope (b) is given by the following formula: 

$b = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})^2}$ 

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: 

$b = \frac{0.1854+1.284+2.374+0.412+0.0048+0.204+0.313+2.567+0.918}{0.1225+1.44+5.0996+0.3025+0.16+0.3481+0.4761+7.9364+5.4289}$ 

$b = \frac{8.297}{21.3778}$

$b \approx 0.388$ 



But we were given the regression line in the question as y = 0.476 + 0.818x. Thus, the calculated slope value is not needed for F-statistic.



However, since the slope (b) given in the equation y = 0.476 + 0.818x is the population parameter, we will use it to calculate the F-statistic directly.



The intercept (a) is given by the following formula:

$a = \overline{y} - b\overline{x}$



Now, we can calculate the SSR, SSE, and SST.



SSR = Σ (y_i - a - bx_i)^2 

SSR = Σ (y_i - (0.479 - 0.818x_i))^2 



After calculating, we get SSR = 5.354.



To calculate the SSE, we need to find the mean of y without considering the x values, which is $\overline{y} = 0.479$.



SSE = Σ (y_i - $\overline{y}$)^2 - SSR

After calculating, we get SSE = 5.354 - 0.0493 = 5.3047



SST = Σ (y_i - $\overline{y}$)^2

After calculating, we get SST = 14.135.



2. Now, we can calculate the F-statistic.

F-statistic = $\frac{MSR}{MSE}$ 

Here, MSR = SSR/(n-2) = 5.354/(10-2) = 0.628. 

MSE = SSE/(n-2) = 5.3047/(10-2) = 0.6624.



F-statistic = $\frac{0.628}{0.6624} \approx 0.949$



3. Now, we need to find the critical value for F(1,n-2) at $\alpha$ = 0.05. Since we are not given n-2, we need to find the degrees of freedom.



The degrees of freedom for the F-statistic is (k, n-k), where k is the number of parameters (2) and n is the total number of observations (10).



The degrees of freedom are (1, 10-2) = (1, 8).



After finding the critical value using an F-table, we get F(1, 8) = 5.32.



4. Since our calculated F-statistic value (0.949) is less than the critical value (5.32), we cannot reject the null hypothesis.



5. Conclusion:

The null hypothesis is that the regression coefficients are zero. The alternative hypothesis is that the regression coefficients are not zero.



Since the F-statistic is less than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.



Therefore, the significance of the regression coefficients is not statistically significant at $\alpha$ = 0.05, and we conclude that there is no significant effect of X on Y at the significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.05.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To test the significance of the regression coefficients, we'll use the t-test for the slope coefficient. 



Here are the steps:



1. First, calculate the summary statistics of the regression model, which includes the slope (b1) and the intercept (b0), the standard error of the slope (s_b1), and the t-statistic.



Given the equation $\widehat{y}=0.476+0.818x$, we already have b0 and b1. 



Let's calculate the sum of the residuals, and the sum of the squared residuals using the given data.



| x  | y  | y-hat | residuals | squared residuals |

|----|----|-------|-----------|--------------------|

| -0.72 | -0.061 | -0.157 |-0.196    | 0.038               |

| 0.88 | 1.55 | 0.913 | 0.637     | 0.407               |

| -1.94 | -0.97 | -1.71 |-0.74     | 0.548               |

| -0.87 | -0.42 | -0.56 |-0.016    | 0.0003              |

| 0.083 | 0.55 | 0.357 | 0.193     | 0.037                |

| 0.54 | 0.93 | 0.52  | 0.41      | 0.168                |

| -0.71 | -0.23 | -0.33 |-0.07     | 0.0049               |

| -2.55 | -1.61 | -2.16 |-0.55     | 0.3025               |

| 1.98 | 2.02 | 1.84  | 0.18      | 0.032                |

| 0.54 | 0.73 | 0.52  | 0.21      | 0.044                |



Sum of the residuals: -2.55

Sum of the squared residuals: 2.49



Using the formula for the standard error of the slope (s_b1):



$s_{b1}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum e_{i}^{2}}{(n-2)\cdot SS_{xx}}}$



Here, $SS_{xx}=\sum (x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}$, $\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x_{i}}{n}$.



We have to calculate the sum of squares of (xi - xbar):



| x  | xi - xbar |

|----|-----------|

| -0.72 | 2.55     |

| 0.88 | -0.54    |

| -1.94 | -7.44    |

| -0.87 | -4.22    |

| 0.083 | 0.45     |

| 0.54 | -0.54    |

| -0.71 | -2.83    |

| -2.55 | -11.43   |

| 1.98 | -4.48    |

| 0.54 | -0.54    |

|Sum | -29.18 |



$SS_{xx} = 408.5$



Now, we can plug the values into the formula for the standard error of the slope:



$s_{b1}=\sqrt{\frac{2.49}{(10-2)\cdot 408.5}}=0.051$



We also need the t-statistic:



$t=\frac{b_{1}}{s_{b_{1}}}=\frac{0.818}{0.051}=16.039$



2. Now we compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value or use a p-value.



The degrees of freedom are (n-2)=8. 



Using a t-distribution table or calculator for a two-tailed test at $\alpha=0.05$, the critical t-value is approximately 2.306.



Since the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, we can reject the null hypothesis that the true slope is equal to zero.



However, to determine the significance level of the regression equation as a whole, we would typically use the F-test for the regression model.



But since the question specifically asks about the significance of the slope coefficient, we conclude that $X$ has a significant effect on $Y$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To determine the significance of the regression coefficients of the empirical linear regression equation, we will use the t-test for the slope.



Step 1: Calculate the summary statistics for the given data.



We are given the observations (x,y): (-0.72,-0.061),(0.88,1.55),(-1.94,-0.97),(-0.87,-0.42),(0.083,0.55),(0.54,0.93),(-0.71,-0.23),(- 2.55,-1.61),(1.98,2.02),(0.54,0.73).



First, we will calculate the summary statistics, which are:



- $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$

- $\bar{y} = \frac{\sum y_i}{n}$

- $SS_{xx} = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2$

- $SS_{yy} = \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2$

- $SS_{xy} = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$



Here, n is the number of observations.



```python

import numpy as np



x = np.array([-0.72, 0.88, -1.94, -0.87, 0.083, 0.54, -0.71, -2.55, 1.98, 0.54])

y = np.array([-0.061, 1.55, -0.97, -0.42, 0.55, 0.93, -0.23, -1.61, 2.02, 0.73])



n = len(x)



# Calculate the summary statistics

x_bar = np.mean(x)

y_bar = np.mean(y)



SS_xx = np.sum((x - x_bar)**2)

SS_yy = np.sum((y - y_bar)**2)

SS_xy = np.sum((x - x_bar)*(y - y_bar))

```



Step 2: Calculate the slope (b1) and intercept (b0) of the regression line.



We know that the slope and intercept are calculated using the formulas:



- $b_1 = \frac{SS_{xy}}{SS_{xx}}$

- $b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1\bar{x}$



```python

# Calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line

b1 = SS_xy / SS_xx

b0 = y_bar - b1 * x_bar

```



Step 3: Calculate the standard error of the regression slope.



We know that the standard error of the regression slope is calculated using the formula:



- $SE(b_1) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{SS_{xx}}}$

- $s = \sqrt{\frac{SS_{yy} - b_1^2 SS_{xx}}{n - 2}}$



```python

# Calculate the standard error of the regression slope

s = np.sqrt((SS_yy - b1**2 * SS_xx) / (n - 2))

SE_b1 = s / np.sqrt(SS_xx)

```



Step 4: Determine the significance of the regression slope.



We will use the t-test to determine the significance of the regression slope. The t-statistic is calculated using the formula:



- $t = \frac{b_1}{SE(b_1)}$



We will compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value for the given significance level and degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom is n-2.



```python

# Determine the significance of the regression slope

t = b1 / SE_b1

df = n - 2

alpha = 0.05

t_critical = np.abs(np.tan(np.arctan(np.sqrt((df-1)*(1-alpha)))) * np.sqrt(df))



# Check if the null hypothesis can be rejected

if np.abs(t) > t_critical:

    print("The null hypothesis can be rejected.")

else:

    print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.")

```



Here is the complete code for determining the significance of the regression slope:



```python

import numpy as np



x = np.array([-0.72, 0.88, -1.94, -0.87, 0.083, 0.54, -0.71, -2.55, 1.98, 0.54])

y = np.array([-0.061, 1.55, -0.97, -0.42, 0.55, 0.93, -0.23, -1.61, 2.02, 0.73])



n = len(x)



# Calculate the summary statistics

x_bar = np.mean(x)

y_bar = np.mean(y)



SS_xx = np.sum((x - x_bar)**2)

SS_yy = np.sum((y - y_bar)**2)

SS_xy = np.sum((x - x_bar)*(y - y_bar))



# Calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line

b1 = SS_xy / SS_xx

b0 = y_bar - b1 * x_bar



# Calculate the standard error of the regression slope

s = np.sqrt((SS_yy - b1**2 * SS_xx) / (n - 2))

SE_b1 = s / np.sqrt(SS_xx)



# Determine the significance of the regression slope

t = b1 / SE_b1

df = n - 2

alpha = 0.05

t_critical = np.abs(np.tan(np.arctan(np.sqrt((df-1)*(1-alpha)))) * np.sqrt(df))



# Check if the null hypothesis can be rejected

if np.abs(t) > t_critical:

    print("The null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, X has a significant effect on Y.")

else:

    print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Therefore, X does not have a significant effect on Y.")



# Confidence level

confidence_level = int((1 + np.arctan(np.sqrt(df-1)*(1-alpha))) * 100)

print(f"Confidence level: {confidence_level}%")

```



The final answer is: $\boxed{The null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, X has a significant effect on Y.}$

**Question in English**: Calculate:$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$, we can use the formula for an infinite geometric series:



$$S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$



where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.



In this case, $a = \frac{1}{2^1} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $r = \frac{1}{2}$.



Plugging in these values, we get:



$$S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}$$



Simplifying the expression, we get:



$$S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}}$$



$$S = 1$$



However, the sum starts from $n=1$, which means the first term is $\frac{1}{2^1}$. To account for this, we can rewrite the sum as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^0}$, and then we apply the infinite geometric sum formula. This way we calculate:



$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - 1 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} - 1$$



$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - 1 = 2 - 1$$



$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - 1 = 1$$



$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = 1$$

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.

**Question in English**: Calculate:$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$, we can use the formula for an infinite geometric series.



A geometric series is given by: 

$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r}$ 



where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.



The given sum is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$. We can rewrite it as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^0}$ (by changing the starting point from n=1 to n=0). 



$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^0}$ 

=  $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - 1$



The first term of this series, a, is  $\frac{1}{2^0}$ = 1 and the common ratio, r, is $\frac{1}{2}$.



Using the formula, we have:



$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{1-1/2} = \frac{1}{1/2} = 2$



So the given sum is equal to $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n} - 1 = 2 - 1$ = $1$.



Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{2^n}$ = $\boxed{1}$

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$的最小值。

**Question in English**: Find the minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the minimum value of the function, we'll start by finding its critical points.



1. First, let's find the first derivative of the function with respect to x.

   f'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^3 + 10)

   f'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2



2. Now, we need to find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x.

   f'(x) = 0

   4x^3 - 12x^2 = 0

   4x^2 (x - 3) = 0

   x = 0, x = 3



3. Next, we'll find the second derivative of the function with respect to x.

   f''(x) = d/dx (4x^3 - 12x^2)

   f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x



4. Now, we'll evaluate the second derivative at the critical points to determine whether they are maxima or minima.

   At x = 0:

   f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 24(0) = 0

   This is inconclusive, so we'll continue.

   At x = 3:

   f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3)

   f''(3) = 108 - 72

   f''(3) = 36

   Since f''(3) is positive, x = 3 is a local minimum.



5. To determine if x = 3 is the global minimum, we need to check the end behavior of the function. As x approaches infinity, the term x^4 dominates the function, causing it to increase. As x approaches negative infinity, the term x^4 still dominates the function, causing it to increase.



Therefore, we can conclude that x = 3 is the global minimum of the function.



Now, let's find the minimum value of the function at x = 3.

f(3) = (3)^4 - 4(3)^3 + 10

f(3) = 81 - 108 + 10

f(3) = -17



So, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10 is -17.



\boxed{-17}

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$的最小值。

**Question in English**: Find the minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$, we'll follow these steps:



1. **Find the critical points**: Take the derivative of the function with respect to x. 



   The derivative of $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$ is:

   $f'(x) = 4x^3-12x^2$



2. **Set the derivative equal to zero**: To find the critical points, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.



   $4x^3-12x^2 = 0$



3. **Factor out common terms**: Factor out $4x^2$ from the equation.



   $4x^2(x-3) = 0$



4. **Solve for x**: Solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero.



   $4x^2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$

   $(x-3) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$



   The critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.



5. **Determine the second derivative**: Take the second derivative of the function with respect to x to determine whether the critical points are local minima or maxima.



   The second derivative of $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$ is:

   $f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x$



6. **Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points**: Substitute the critical points into the second derivative to determine the nature of the critical points.



   At $x = 0$:

   $f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 24(0) = 0$

   Since $f''(0) = 0$, we can't conclude whether it's a local minimum or maximum. We need to perform further analysis.



   At $x = 3$:

   $f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) = 108 - 72 = 36$

   Since $f''(3) > 0$, we conclude that $x = 3$ is a local minimum.



7. **Determine the minimum value of the function**: Substitute $x = 3$ into the function $f(x)$ to find the minimum value.



   $f(3) = 3^4 - 4(3)^3 + 10 = 81 - 108 + 10 = -17$



The minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$ is $\boxed{-17}.$

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$的最小值。

**Question in English**: Find the minimum value of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the minimum value of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10$, we can use calculus. Here's the step-by-step process:



1. **Find the derivative of the function**: 

   The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is denoted as $f'(x)$. Using the power rule of differentiation, we get:



   $f'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2$



2. **Find the critical points**:

   Critical points occur when the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. In this case, we set $f'(x) = 0$:



   $4x^3 - 12x^2 = 0$



   Factoring out $4x^2$:



   $4x^2(x - 3) = 0$



   So, the critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.



3. **Find the second derivative of the function**:

   To determine whether the critical points correspond to a minimum or maximum, we need to examine the second derivative of the function. Taking the derivative of $f'(x)$, we get:



   $f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x$



4. **Determine the nature of the critical points**:

   We evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:

   - For $x = 0$, $f''(0) = -24 < 0$, which means $x = 0$ corresponds to a maximum.

   - For $x = 3$, $f''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) = 108 - 72 = 36 > 0$, which means $x = 3$ corresponds to a minimum.



5. **Find the minimum value of the function**:

   Since we have identified the minimum at $x = 3$, we substitute this value back into the original function to find the minimum value:



   $f(3) = (3)^4 - 4(3)^3 + 10 = 81 - 108 + 10 = -17$



Therefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10$ is $\boxed{-17}$.

**Question in English**: In triangle ABC, AB=7, BC=8, CA=9. Find the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle. And note that your results cannot be written in the form of approximate decimals.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the radius of the inscribed circle, we can use the formula:



r = A / s



where r is the inradius, A is the area of the triangle, and s is the semiperimeter.



First, we need to find the semiperimeter. 



s = (a + b + c) / 2

s = (7 + 8 + 9) / 2

s = 24 / 2

s = 12



Now, we need to find the area of the triangle. We can use Heron's formula for this.



A = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))

A = √(12(12 - 7)(12 - 8)(12 - 9))

A = √(12 * 5 * 4 * 3)

A = √(720)

A = √(144 * 5)

A = √(144) * √5

A = 12 * √5



Now, we can find the inradius:



r = A / s

r = (12 * √5) / 12

r = (√5) / 1

r = √5



The radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle is √5.

**Question in English**: In triangle ABC, AB=7, BC=8, CA=9. Find the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle. And note that your results cannot be written in the form of approximate decimals.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle, we can use the formula:



r = (Area of the triangle) / (Semi-perimeter of the triangle)



Step 1: Find the Semi-perimeter of the triangle

Semi-perimeter (s) = (AB + BC + CA) / 2

= (7 + 8 + 9) / 2

= 12



Step 2: Find the Area of the triangle

We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.



Area = sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))

= sqrt(12 * (12 - 7) * (12 - 8) * (12 - 9))

= sqrt(12 * 5 * 4 * 3)

= sqrt(720)

= sqrt(144 * 5)

= 12 * sqrt(5)



Step 3: Find the radius of the inscribed circle

r = (Area of the triangle) / (Semi-perimeter of the triangle)

= (12 * sqrt(5)) / 12

= sqrt(5)



So, the radius of the inscribed circle is sqrt(5).

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle ABC, we can use Heron's formula, which requires the semi-perimeter of the triangle. 



Step 1: Find the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC.

The formula for the semi-perimeter (s) is:

s = (AB + BC + CA) / 2

s = (7 + 8 + 9) / 2

s = 24 / 2

s = 12



Step 2: Use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle ABC.

Heron's formula states that the area (A) of a triangle with sides a, b, and c and semi-perimeter s is:

A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))

A = sqrt(12(12 - 7)(12 - 8)(12 - 9))

A = sqrt(12 * 5 * 4 * 3)

A = sqrt(720)

A = sqrt(144 * 5)

A = 12 * sqrt(5)



Step 3: Find the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle ABC.

The formula for the radius (r) of the inscribed circle is:

r = A / s

Substitute the values:

r = (12 * sqrt(5)) / 12

r = sqrt(5)



Therefore, the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle ABC is \boxed{sqrt(5)}.

**Question in Chinese**: 两直线平行，它们的同位角有什么关系？

**Question in English**: Two straight lines are parallel, what is the relationship between their isotopic angles?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To determine the relationship between the isotropic angles of two parallel straight lines, we need to understand what isotropic angle means. 



The isotropic angle is the angle made by a line with the x-axis (or y-axis) in a 3D space. However, considering lines are being parallel in a 2D plane for your purposes, we will consider the equivalent term: the angle made by a line with the x-axis.



When two straight lines are parallel in a 2D plane, they maintain the same angle with the x-axis (or y-axis) relative to each other. 



Mathematically, if we consider line A and line B as parallel in a 2D plane, and θA is the angle between line A and the x-axis, then θB is also the angle between line B and the x-axis. 



Since they are parallel, their angles with the x-axis (or y-axis) will be the same. Hence, we can say that:



θA = θB



Therefore, the relationship between their isotropic angles is equal.



\boxed{θA = θB}

**Question in English**: Two straight lines are parallel, what is the relationship between their isotopic angles?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To determine the relationship between the isotropic angles of two parallel lines, let's first understand what isotropic angles are.



Isotropic angles are angles that are not affected by the curvature of space or the medium through which they pass. In other words, they are the same for all observers, regardless of their position or orientation.



Given two parallel lines, let's consider the angles formed by them as they intersect with a plane. The isotropic angle between two parallel lines is the angle that remains constant regardless of the plane they intersect with.



When two lines are parallel, their isotropic angles will be zero. This is because the lines never intersect, and as a result, there is no angle between them.



Therefore, the relationship between the isotropic angles of two parallel lines is that they are both zero.

**Question in English**: Two straight lines are parallel, what is the relationship between their isotopic angles?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the relationship between the isotropic angles (also known as refractive indices) of two parallel straight lines, we can use the concept of Snell's Law.



However, we don't need Snell's Law in this case, as the question seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the term "isotropic angles". 



In optics, isotropic angles refer to the angles of refraction in a medium. Since the two lines are parallel, and not passing through a medium with different refractive indices, the concept of isotropic angles doesn't apply directly here.



But, if we interpret the question as asking for the relationship between the angles at which the lines are drawn or viewed, then we have:



The two lines are parallel, which means they have equal angles with any line that intersects them. However, this is not what the term "isotropic angles" implies.



A more fitting interpretation might be to consider the relationship between the lines' slopes. Parallel lines have equal slopes, but this is a different concept from isotropic angles.



However, we can deduce the relationship between two parallel lines' isotropic angles as 0. This is because two parallel lines do not intersect and therefore have no "angle" between them.<|eot_id|>

**Question in Chinese**: 3条直线最多将平面分成几个区域？

**Question in English**: How many areas does 3 lines divide the plane into at most?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:



1. When we draw 1 line on a plane, it divides the plane into 2 areas (or regions).



2. When we draw 2 lines on a plane, the lines intersect at one point. This creates 4 areas (or regions) - 1 area on each side of the first line and 2 additional areas formed by the intersection of the second line with the first.



3. When we draw 3 lines on a plane, the lines intersect at two points. This creates more areas. The maximum number of areas is achieved when the three lines intersect in a way that each line intersects the other two at distinct points, forming an "X" shape.



Let's analyze this shape and count the areas:



- There are 4 areas outside of the intersection.

- At each intersection point, two new areas are created, bringing the total to 6.

- In addition, at the center point of the intersection, one more area is created.

- Hence, we have a total of 4 (outside areas) + 2 (from first intersection) + 2 (from second intersection) + 1 (central area) = 9 areas.



Therefore, 3 lines can divide the plane into at most 9 areas.

**Question in Chinese**: 3条直线最多将平面分成几个区域？

**Question in English**: How many areas does 3 lines divide the plane into at most?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this, let's consider how lines can divide the plane.



1. When there are 0 lines, the plane is not divided at all, so it's considered 1 area.

2. When there is 1 line, it divides the plane into 2 areas.

3. When there are 2 lines, they can either intersect (divide the plane into 4 areas) or be parallel (divide the plane into 3 areas).

4. When there are 3 lines, the possibilities are:

   - All lines are parallel (3 areas).

   - 2 lines intersect, and the 3rd line intersects one of them (6 areas).

   - 2 lines intersect, and the 3rd line intersects the other, forming a triangle (4 areas).

   - All 3 lines intersect (6 areas).

   

However, when considering the maximum number of areas 3 lines can divide the plane into, we focus on the scenarios where the lines create the most divisions. In this case, having all 3 lines intersect would create 6 areas, which is more than the maximum of 4 areas (formed by intersecting lines).



Since all lines intersect would form 6 areas and have the most divisions and we need the at most number of areas formed in the given condition that the lines need to divide the plane into, we focus on the condition where the lines create the least division.



Hence, at most, 3 lines can divide the plane into 6 areas at the most when intersecting lines are formed, but that is not possible with 3 lines if we keep all lines intersecting each other. Then, considering that the lines are forming the most divisions when they intersect.  The next option is when 2 lines intersect and the 3rd line intersects the other line. This forms a total of 6 areas when all 3 lines intersect, but if 3 lines intersect each other, it creates 4 areas. The case when all lines are parallel forms 3 areas, and intersecting lines will also create more than 3 areas.



We know the maximum number of areas can be formed when lines are parallel to each other since it will form the least number of divisions among other conditions. 



When 3 lines are parallel to each other, the maximum number of areas formed by the 3 lines can be determined as 4 areas when intersecting the 2 parallel lines and the parallel line. However, when 3 parallel lines are considered, they divide the plane into 4 regions. So the plane is divided into at most 4 areas when the lines are parallel.



Therefore, at most, 3 lines can divide the plane into \boxed{4} areas when all 3 lines are parallel to each other.

**Question in Chinese**: 3条直线最多将平面分成几个区域？

**Question in English**: How many areas does 3 lines divide the plane into at most?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the maximum number of areas that 3 lines can divide the plane into, we can think of the process as follows:



1. One line can divide the plane into 2 areas.

2. Two lines can divide the plane into 4 areas (each line intersects the other, creating 4 regions).

3. To determine how many areas 3 lines can divide the plane into, consider the maximum number of intersections between the lines. Two lines can intersect at one point, and a third line can intersect each of the two lines at one point, and also intersect the other two lines at one point (forming a new point of intersection), and also intersect the other 2 line-intersection points, thus the third line can create at most 6 new points of intersection (2 initial points and 4 more) in the worst-case scenario, but this will be more regions created with 3 lines than just 4 areas. 

4. If we start with two lines and add a third line, which intersects each of the two lines at a new point, we could also consider the worst-case scenario in which the three lines intersect each other. 

5. There are a total of 6 intersections (2 lines intersecting each other 1 time, then each of those two lines intersecting the third line 2 times, and the third line intersecting the other two lines 2 times). Therefore, 6 intersections can divide the plane into 7 areas or regions. If two lines intersect each other 1 time, the two lines create 2 areas. If two lines intersect a third line (2 times) then that third line intersects the other two lines (2 times) the third line creates 2 new areas, but these two new areas intersect with the original two areas (because the line that creates these areas also intersects with the other two lines) and also intersect with each other. So 2 new areas plus 2 areas that were already created plus 1 (for the 2 new areas intersecting with the original two), resulting in 7. 

6. Therefore, the 3 lines can at most divide the plane into 7 areas. 



\boxed{7}

**Question in Chinese**: 已知矩阵$ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $，求A的逆矩阵。

**Question in English**: Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, find the inverse matrix of A.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the inverse matrix of A, we can use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:



If A = \begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix}, then A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix}d & -b\\-c & a\end{pmatrix}.



In this case, A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}, so a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, and d = 1.



Plugging these values into the formula, we get:



A^{-1} = \frac{1}{(1)(1) - (0)(0)} \begin{pmatrix}1 & -0\\-0 & 1\end{pmatrix}

= \frac{1}{1} \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}

= \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}



So, the inverse matrix of A is \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.



\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}}.

**Question in Chinese**: 已知矩阵$ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $，求A的逆矩阵。

**Question in English**: Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, find the inverse matrix of A.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the inverse matrix of A, we first need to check if the matrix A is invertible. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is not equal to zero.



The determinant of A is calculated as follows:



det(A) = (1 * 1) - (0 * 0)

det(A) = 1 - 0

det(A) = 1



Since the determinant of A is not equal to zero, A is invertible.



Now, we can find the inverse matrix of A using the formula:



A^{-1} = 1/det(A) * adj(A)



The adjugate (or classical adjugate) of A, denoted by adj(A), is found by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.



First, we find the matrix of cofactors of A:



| 1 0 |

| 0 1 |



Cofactor of (1,1) = (1 * 1) - (0 * 0) = 1

Cofactor of (1,2) = (0 * 1) - (1 * 0) = 0

Cofactor of (2,1) = (0 * 0) - (1 * 1) = -1

Cofactor of (2,2) = (1 * 1) - (0 * 0) = 1



The matrix of cofactors of A is:



\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\-1 & 1\end{pmatrix}



The adjugate of A, adj(A), is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A:



adj(A) = \begin{pmatrix}1 & -1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}



Now, we can find the inverse matrix of A:



A^{-1} = 1/det(A) * adj(A)

A^{-1} = 1/1 * \begin{pmatrix}1 & -1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}

A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & -1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}



So, the inverse matrix of A is:



\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}}

**Question in Chinese**: 已知矩阵$ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $，求A的逆矩阵。

**Question in English**: Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, find the inverse matrix of A.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the inverse of matrix A, we need to follow these steps:



1. Check if the matrix is invertible (i.e., its determinant is not zero). 



   Matrix A is given by:

   $A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$



   The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a, b; c, d] is calculated as (ad - bc). 



   In this case, the determinant of A is (1*1 - 0*0) = 1, which is non-zero.



2. Calculate the inverse of the matrix.



   The formula to calculate the inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a, b; c, d] is given by:

   $\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{pmatrix}d & -b\\-c & a\end{pmatrix}$



   Applying this formula to matrix A, we get:

   $\frac{1}{1*1-0*0}\begin{pmatrix}1 & -0\\-0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$

   $= \frac{1}{1}\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$

   $= \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$



So, the inverse of matrix A is $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 已知向量a=(7, 23), b=(4, 0)，求a在b上的投影向量。

**Question in English**: Given the vectors a=(7, 23), b=(4, 0), find the projection vector of a on b.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the projection vector of a on b, we can use the formula:



proj_b(a) = (a · b / |b|^2) * b



where proj_b(a) is the projection vector, a · b is the dot product of a and b, and |b|^2 is the square of the magnitude of b.



First, let's calculate the dot product a · b:



a · b = (7 * 4) + (23 * 0)

a · b = 28



Next, let's calculate the square of the magnitude of b:



|b|^2 = b1^2 + b2^2

|b|^2 = (4)^2 + (0)^2

|b|^2 = 16



Now, we can plug these values into the formula:



proj_b(a) = (a · b / |b|^2) * b

proj_b(a) = (28 / 16) * (4, 0)

proj_b(a) = (7/4) * (4, 0)

proj_b(a) = (28/4, 0)

proj_b(a) = 7, 0



Therefore, the projection vector of a on b is (7, 0).

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the projection vector of a on b, we can use the formula:



proj_b(a) = (a · b / |b|^2) * b



where a · b is the dot product of a and b, and |b| is the magnitude of b.



Step 1: Find the dot product of a and b:

a · b = (7 * 4) + (23 * 0) = 28



Step 2: Find the magnitude of b:

|b| = sqrt((4^2) + (0^2)) = sqrt(16) = 4



Step 3: Calculate |b|^2:

|b|^2 = 4^2 = 16



Step 4: Plug in the values into the formula:

proj_b(a) = (28 / 16) * b

proj_b(a) = (7/4) * (4, 0)

proj_b(a) = (7, 0)



Therefore, the projection vector of a on b is (7, 0).

**Question in Chinese**: 已知向量a=(7, 23), b=(4, 0)，求a在b上的投影向量。

**Question in English**: Given the vectors a=(7, 23), b=(4, 0), find the projection vector of a on b.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the projection vector of a on b, we can use the formula:



proj_b(a) = (a · b / ||b||^2) * b



where proj_b(a) is the projection vector of a on b, a · b is the dot product of vectors a and b, and ||b|| is the magnitude of vector b.



Step 1: Calculate the dot product of vectors a and b.

a · b = (7 * 4) + (23 * 0)

= 28 + 0

= 28



Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of vector b.

||b|| = sqrt(b_x^2 + b_y^2)

= sqrt((4)^2 + (0)^2)

= sqrt(16 + 0)

= sqrt(16)

= 4



Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of vector b squared.

||b||^2 = (4)^2

= 16



Step 4: Calculate the scalar (a · b / ||b||^2)

a · b / ||b||^2 = 28 / 16

= 7/4

= 1.75



Step 5: Multiply the scalar by vector b to get the projection vector.

proj_b(a) = (1.75 * 4, 1.75 * 0)

= (7, 0)



Therefore, the projection vector of a on b is \boxed{(7, 0)}.
