**Question in Chinese**: 令某厂生产的节能灯的使用寿命服从 $Exp (1/6000)$．经过技术革新后，该厂生产出一批新的节能灯，从中取出20个节能灯来做实验，预定到第5个失效时试验停止，而测得前5个节能灯的工作时间（单位： h ）分别为6000,6300,6600,6700,6800.问在显著性水平为0.05时，技术革新后节能灯的平均寿命是否提高了？

**Question in English**: Let the service life of energy-saving lamps produced by a certain factory follow $Exp (1/6000)$. After technical innovation the factory produced a new batch of energy-saving lamps. 20 energy-saving lamps were taken out for experimentation, and the experiment was stopped when the 5 one failed. The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps (in hours) were measured to be 6000, 6300 6600, 6700, and 6800, respectively. Has the average life of the energy-saving lamps increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we can use the Chi-squared distribution to determine whether the observed failure times are significantly different from the expected failure times under the assumption of exponential distribution with rate parameter λ = 1/6000.



Step 1: Determine the observed failure times and the expected failure times



Let the 5 observed failure times be $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_5$, which are given as 6000, 6300, 6600, 6700, and 6800. 



Since we are given that the service life of the lamps follow an exponential distribution $Exp (1/6000)$, the expected failure time for a single lamp is 6000 hours.



Step 2: Calculate the expected number of failures at the observed failure times under the original distribution.



We assume that the failure rate is 1/6000. The probability that a lamp fails in the time interval [0, 6000] is 1 - e^(-1/6000) ≈ 0.00016. Since 5 lamps were observed to fail, we can expect approximately 0.00016 × 20 = 0.0032 lamps to fail in this interval.



Similarly, the probability that a lamp fails in the time interval (6000, 6300) is e^(-1/6000) - e^(-1/6000 - 1/300) ≈ 0.00032. Therefore, we can expect approximately 0.00032 × 20 = 0.0064 lamps to fail in this interval.



Similarly, the probability that a lamp fails in the time interval (6300, 6600) is e^(-1/300) - e^(-1/300 - 1/600) ≈ 0.00126. Therefore, we can expect approximately 0.00126 × 20 = 0.0252 lamps to fail in this interval.



Similarly, the probability that a lamp fails in the time interval (6600, 6700) is e^(-1/600) - e^(-1/600 - 1/100) ≈ 0.0025. Therefore, we can expect approximately 0.0025 × 20 = 0.05 lamps to fail in this interval.



Similarly, the probability that a lamp fails in the time interval (6700, 6800) is e^(-1/100) - e^(-1/100 - 1/40) ≈ 0.005. Therefore, we can expect approximately 0.005 × 20 = 0.1 lamps to fail in this interval.



Now, we calculate the expected number of failures at the observed failure times:



| Interval        | Expected Number of Failures |

|-----------------|-----------------------------|

| (0, 6000)       | 0.0032                       |

| (6000, 6300)    | 0.0064                       |

| (6300, 6600)    | 0.0252                       |

| (6600, 6700)    | 0.05                        |

| (6700, 6800)    | 0.1                         |



Step 3: Calculate the Chi-squared statistic



Let $E_i$ be the expected number of failures at the observed failure times and $O_i$ be the observed number of failures at the observed failure times. The Chi-squared statistic is given by:



χ² = ∑ (O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i



Substituting the values, we get:



χ² = (1 - 0.0032)^2 / 0.0032 + (0 - 0.0064)^2 / 0.0064 + (0 - 0.0252)^2 / 0.0252 + (1 - 0.05)^2 / 0.05 + (3 - 0.1)^2 / 0.1

= 0.9649 / 0.0032 + 0 / 0.0064 + 1.2654 / 0.0252 + 0.45 / 0.05 + 9.8 / 0.1

= 301.22 + 0 + 50.22 + 9 + 98

= 458.44



Step 4: Determine the degrees of freedom and the critical value of the Chi-squared distribution



The degrees of freedom for the Chi-squared distribution are given by the number of bins minus 1, which is 5 - 1 = 4.



At a significance level of 0.05, the critical value of the Chi-squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom is approximately 9.488.



Step 5: Compare the calculated Chi-squared statistic with the critical value and draw a conclusion



Since the calculated Chi-squared statistic (458.44) is greater than the critical value (9.488), we reject the null hypothesis that the observed failure times are significantly different from the expected failure times under the original distribution.



This suggests that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05.

**Question in English**: Let the service life of energy-saving lamps produced by a certain factory follow $Exp (1/6000)$. After technical innovation the factory produced a new batch of energy-saving lamps. 20 energy-saving lamps were taken out for experimentation, and the experiment was stopped when the 5 one failed. The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps (in hours) were measured to be 6000, 6300 6600, 6700, and 6800, respectively. Has the average life of the energy-saving lamps increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we will use the chi-squared test for goodness of fit.



Step 1: 

First, let's assume that the service life of the lamps is still exponential with parameter $\lambda$. We want to test the null hypothesis that $\lambda$ is equal to 1/6000 against the alternative hypothesis that $\lambda$ is greater than 1/6000.



Step 2: 

Since the time until failure is the sum of n independent exponentially distributed variables, it follows a Gamma distribution with parameters (n, $\lambda$). 



In this case, n = 5 for the first five lamps that failed. 



We can find the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter $\lambda$ of the Gamma distribution, given the observed data (6000, 6300, 6600, 6700, 6800) which is the sum of five exponential distributions.  



However, for exponential distributions, there is a closed-form expression for the MLE.



Let $x_i$ be the observed times for i from 1 to 5, and let $\lambda$ be the rate parameter for the exponential distribution.



$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{5}{\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i} = \frac{5}{6000 + 6300 + 6600 + 6700 + 6800}$ = 0.000625.



This is not the MLE for the Gamma distribution but the MLE for exponential, as Gamma and Exponential are related, but are not the same.



Step 3: 

The chi-squared test statistic is defined as:



$\chi^2 = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \log\left(\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{\lambda_0}\right) + \frac{\lambda_0 x_i}{\hat{\lambda}} \right]$,



where $\lambda_0$ is the rate parameter of the null hypothesis (1/6000) and $\hat{\lambda}$ is the MLE of $\lambda$.



Now we can calculate the value of the test statistic:



$\hat{\lambda} = 0.000625$

$\lambda_0 = \frac{1}{6000} = 0.0001667$

$\chi^2 = 2 * [5 * (\log(0.000625 / 0.0001667)) + (0.0001667 * \frac{6000 + 6300 + 6600 + 6700 + 6800}{0.000625})]$



$= 2 * [5 * (\log(0.003767)) +  176.00]$



$= 2 * [5 * (-2.5729) + 176.00]$



$= 2 * (-12.8645 + 176.00)$



$= 2 * 163.1355$



$\chi^2 \approx 326.27$.



Step 4:

Since the chi-squared test statistic is calculated under the null hypothesis, we can use it to find the p-value, which is the probability that the test statistic will be at least as extreme as it is, assuming the null hypothesis is true.



This p-value is calculated using the chi-squared distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom (where k is the number of parameters estimated).  Since the MLE is a rate parameter (lambda) for the exponential distribution, we actually have only one parameter being estimated.  Therefore, k=1 and the degrees of freedom is 1.



Using the chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom, we find that the p-value of the test is approximately 0.



Step 5: 

Since the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation.



Confidence level: $\boxed{100\%}$.<|eot_id|>

The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps (in hours) were measured to be 6000, 6300 6600, 6700, and 6800, respectively. Has the average life of the energy-saving lamps increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05?

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To determine whether the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation, we can use the chi-square test for goodness of fit.



Let's denote the null hypothesis as H0: The service life of energy-saving lamps follows Exp(1/6000), and the alternative hypothesis as H1: The service life of energy-saving lamps does not follow Exp(1/6000).



Given that the experiment was stopped when the 5th energy-saving lamp failed, the sample follows a right-censored sample.



Let's denote the observed failures at times t1 = 6000, t2 = 6300, t3 = 6600, t4 = 6700, and t5 = 6800 as ni, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since there are 20 lamps, the expected number of failures at time ti is ni = (5/20) * 6000/ti.



To apply the chi-square test for goodness of fit, we can calculate the observed and expected number of failures at time ti.



The observed number of failures at time ti is 1 for all i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 



The expected number of failures at time ti is:

- At ti = 6000, ni = (5/20) * 6000/6000 = 1.25

- At ti = 6300, ni = (5/20) * 6000/6300 = 0.952

- At ti = 6600, ni = (5/20) * 6000/6600 = 0.909

- At ti = 6700, ni = (5/20) * 6000/6700 = 0.883

- At ti = 6800, ni = (5/20) * 6000/6800 = 0.853



Let's calculate the chi-square statistic as follows:



χ² = Σ[(oi - ei)^2 / ei]

   = [(1 - 1.25)^2 / 1.25] + [(1 - 0.952)^2 / 0.952] + [(1 - 0.909)^2 / 0.909] + [(1 - 0.883)^2 / 0.883] + [(1 - 0.853)^2 / 0.853]

   ≈ 3.55



The degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is k - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4.



The critical value for the chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom at a significance level of 0.05 is approximately χ² = 9.488.



Since χ² ≈ 3.55 is less than χ² = 9.488, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05.



Therefore, we cannot conclude that the average life of the energy-saving lamps has increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05.

**Question in English**: Calculate the determinant $\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 5 & 0\\ 2 &  4& -1\\ 0 & -2 &0\end{vmatrix}$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the determinant, we can use the cofactor expansion method. 



First, let's expand the determinant along the first row. 



$\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 5 & 0\\ 2 &  4& -1\\ 0 & -2 &0\end{vmatrix} = 1 \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -1\\ -2 &0\end{vmatrix} - 5 \begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1\\ 0 &0\end{vmatrix} + 0 \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 4\\ 0 & -2\end{vmatrix}$



Now, let's calculate the determinants of the 2x2 submatrices:



$\begin{vmatrix} 4 & -1\\ -2 &0\end{vmatrix} = (4)(0) - (-1)(-2) = -2$



$\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1\\ 0 &0\end{vmatrix} = (2)(0) - (-1)(0) = 0$



Since the last term is zero, we don't need to calculate it.



Now, let's put it all together:



$\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 5 & 0\\ 2 &  4& -1\\ 0 & -2 &0\end{vmatrix} = 1(-2) - 5(0) = -2$



So, the final answer is $\boxed{-2}$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, we can use the formula:



$\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c\\ d & e & f\\ g & h & i\end{vmatrix} = a(ei-fh) - b(di-fg) + c(dh-eg)$



Applying the formula to the given matrix:



$\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 5 & 0\\ 2 &  4& -1\\ 0 & -2 &0\end{vmatrix}$



We have a=1, b=5, c=0, d=2, e=4, f=-1, g=0, h=-2, and i=0. 



Substituting these values into the formula:



$= 1(4(0)-(-1)(-2)) - 5(2(0)-(-1)(0)) + 0(2(-2)-4(0))$



$= 1(0-2) - 5(0-0) + 0(-4-0)$



$= 1(-2) - 5(0) + 0(-4)$



$= -2 - 0 - 0$



$= -2$



Therefore, the determinant of the given matrix is $\boxed{-2}$.

Let's apply this formula to the given matrix:



$\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 5 & 0 \\ 2 & 4 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = 1[(4)(0)-(-1)(-2)] - 5[(2)(0)-(-1)(0)] + 0[(2)(-2)-(4)(0)]$



Now, let's simplify the expression:



$= 1[(4)(0)-(-1)(-2)] - 5[(2)(0)-(-1)(0)]$

$= 1(0-2) - 5(0-0)$

$= 1(-2) - 5(0)$

$= -2$



Therefore, the determinant of the given matrix is -2.



$\boxed{-2}$

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we can start by rewriting the given expression and using the concept of limits.



Step 1: Rewrite the expression

We have, $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}}} $.



Step 2: Convert the base

Since $\frac{1}{n}$ is getting very small, we can convert the base of the exponent using a logarithm. 



Step 3: Convert the exponent using a logarithm

We have, $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}}}  = \lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{1}{n} \log (1-\frac{1}{n} )} $



Step 4: Calculate the logarithm

$\frac{1}{n} \log (1-\frac{1}{n} ) = \frac{1}{n} \log ( \frac{n-1}{n} ) = \frac{1}{n} (\log(n-1) - \log(n) ) $



Step 5: Simplify

$\frac{1}{n} (\log(n-1) - \log(n) ) = \frac{1}{n} (\log(n-1) ) - \frac{1}{n} (\log(n) )$



Step 6: Use the definition of derivative of a logarithm to evaluate the limits of the above terms.



Step 7: Evaluate the limits

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} (\log(n-1) ) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log(n-1) }{n} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log(x) }{x} = 0 $, and 

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} (\log(n) ) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log(n) }{n} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log(x) }{x} = 0$



Step 8: Plug in the limits into the exponent

$e^{0 - 0} = e^{0}$



Therefore, the final answer is: 

\boxed{e^0 = 1}

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } $。

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we can use the property of limits which states that if we have a limit of the form $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)^{g(x)}$, then we can rewrite it as $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)^{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} e^{\ln(f(x)^{g(x)})}$, where we use the property of logarithms that $\ln(a^b) = b\ln(a)$. 



Now, let's apply this property to the given problem. We have:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} }$



We can rewrite this limit as:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } = \lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\ln((1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} })}$



Using the property of logarithms, we have:



$\ln((1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} }) = \frac{1}{n} \ln(1-\frac{1}{n} )$



Now, we can rewrite the limit as:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{1}{n} \ln(1-\frac{1}{n} )}$



We can rewrite the expression inside the limit as a Taylor series expansion of the natural logarithm function:



$\ln(1 - \frac{1}{n} ) = - \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{n})^{2} - \frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{n})^{3} -...$



Now, we can rewrite the limit as:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{1}{n} (- \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{n})^{2} - \frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{n})^{3} -...)}$



Using the property of limits that $\lim_{x \to 0} e^{x} = 1$, we can rewrite the limit as:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{1}{n} (- \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{n})^{2} - \frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{n})^{3} -...)} = e^{(- \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{n})^{2} - \frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{n})^{3} -...)}$



Now, we can use the property of limits that $\lim_{x \to 0} a^{x} = 1$ for $|a| \le 1$ to evaluate this limit:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} e^{(- \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{n})^{2} - \frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{n})^{3} -...)} = e^{-1}$



Therefore, we can conclude that:



$\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\frac{1}{n} )^{\frac{1}{n} } = e^{-1} = \boxed{\frac{1}{e}}$

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:



1.  We can rewrite the expression as: $(1 - \frac{1}{n})^{\frac{1}{n}} = (1 + (-\frac{1}{n}))^{\frac{1}{n}}$

2.  The expression is in the form $(1 + a)^n$ where $a$ tends to $0$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$.

3.  We can use the following formula: $\lim_{n \to \infty}(1 + a/n)^n = e^a$ for $a$ being any real number. We can rewrite our expression as $1 + a/n$ where $a$ is $-1$ here.

4.  Now, as $n$ tends to infinity, $a/n = -1/n$ tends to $0$.

5.  Applying the formula, we get $\lim_{n \to \infty}(1 - \frac{1}{n})^{\frac{1}{n}} = \lim_{n \to \infty}(1 + (-\frac{1}{n}))^{\frac{1}{n}} = e^0$.



Now, $e^0$ equals $1$.



Therefore, $\boxed{1}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this integral, we'll first make a substitution to simplify it. Let's substitute $u = \sqrt{x}$, which implies $du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}dx$. This means $2udu = dx$. 



We need to express $x$ in terms of $u$, which is $u^2$. The integral limits change as follows: when $x=0$, $u=\sqrt{0}=0$, and when $x=1$, $u=\sqrt{1}=1$.



Now, the integral becomes:

$ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx = \int_{0}^{1} e^u \cdot 2u \,du $.



This can be written as:

$ 2 \int_{0}^{1} e^u \cdot u \,du $.



To evaluate this integral, we can use integration by parts, which is given by:

$\int u \,dv = uv - \int v \,du$. Here, let's choose $v = e^u$, so $dv = e^u du$.



Applying integration by parts:

$ 2 \int_{0}^{1} e^u \cdot u \,du = 2 \left[ue^u\right]_0^1 - 2\int_{0}^{1} e^u \,du $.



Now, we need to find the integral of $e^u$:

$ 2 \left[ue^u\right]_0^1 - 2\int_{0}^{1} e^u \,du = 2 \left[ue^u\right]_0^1 - 2\left[e^u\right]_0^1 $.



Simplifying:

$ 2 \left[ue^u\right]_0^1 - 2\left[e^u\right]_0^1 = 2 \left[(1)e^1 - (0)e^0\right] - 2\left[e^1 - e^0\right] $.



Since $e^0 = 1$, we have:

$ 2 \left[(1)e^1 - (0)e^0\right] - 2\left[e^1 - e^0\right] = 2(e^1) - 2(e^1 - 1) $.



Further simplification:

$ 2(e^1) - 2(e^1 - 1) = 2 - 2(e^1) + 2 = 4 - 2(e^1) $.



Substituting the value of $e^1$ as approximately 2.718:

$ 4 - 2(e^1) \approx 4 - 2(2.718) \approx 4 - 5.436 = -1.436 $.



However, we should not approximate here as the problem involves calculus. 



We conclude that:

$ 4 - 2(e^1) $.

Now we need to find the value of this expression which involves a constant, in terms of $e$.



So the expression in this case is $4 - 2e$.



$\boxed{4 - 2e}$

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the integral, let's substitute $u = \sqrt{x}$.



This gives $du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}dx$, or $2du = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx$. We need $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx$ in order to substitute it back into our equation. So we use $2du = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx$ and $2 \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx$.



Then we have: 

$\int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx = \frac{1}{2} \int e^{u} \cdot 2du$ 

which simplifies to 

$\int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx = \frac{1}{2} \int e^{u} du$. 



Next we solve the integral: 

$\frac{1}{2} \int e^{u} du = \frac{1}{2} e^u$.



We plug in the new boundaries into $u$. Since $u = \sqrt{x}$, when $x = 0$, we get $u = 0$ and when $x = 1$, we get $u = 1$. 



Our integral is now evaluated to be 

$\frac{1}{2} e^1 - \frac{1}{2} e^0$ 

which simplifies to 

$\frac{1}{2}e - \frac{1}{2}$.



This is our answer.



$\boxed{\frac{1}{2}e - \frac{1}{2}}$

**Question in Chinese**: 计算: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $。

**Question in English**: Calculate: $ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate this integral, we'll use the substitution method. Let's set $ u = \sqrt{x} $. This means $ du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \, dx $ or $ 2du = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx $.



We can rewrite the integral as:

$$ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx = \int e^{u} \cdot 2du $$



However, we still need to find the limits of integration for 'u'. When $x = 0$, $u = \sqrt{0} = 0$. When $x = 1$, $u = \sqrt{1} = 1$.



So, our integral becomes:

$$ \int_{0}^{1} e^{\sqrt{x}} \,dx = \int_{0}^{1} e^{u} \cdot 2du = 2 \int_{0}^{1} e^{u} \,du $$



To find the integral of $e^u$, we'll apply the power rule of integration:

$$ \int e^{u} \,du = e^{u} + C $$



Therefore,

$$ 2 \int_{0}^{1} e^{u} \,du = 2 \left[e^u \right]_0^1 = 2 \left[e^1 - e^0 \right] $$

$$ = 2 \left[e - 1 \right] $$



Now that we have our final result, we can simplify it.



Therefore, 

\boxed{2(e-1)}.



I have 100% confidence in this answer as it follows a standard integration procedure and the result is a known expression involving $e$.<|eot_id|>

**Question in Chinese**: 计算沿回路$L:(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$逆时针方向的积分: $\oint_{L}  \frac{x \mathrm{d} y-y\mathrm{d} x}{x^2+y^2} $。

**Question in English**: Calculate the integral along the loop $L:(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$ counterclockwise:$\oint_{L}  \frac{x \mathrm{d} y-y\mathrm{d} x}{x^2+y^2} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the integral, we'll use the parametric representation of the loop $L$. The given loop $L$ can be represented as $(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$, which can be rewritten as $x^2-2x+1+y^2-2y+1=4$. By completing the square, we get $(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=2^2$, and it is the equation of a circle centered at $(1, 1)$ with a radius of $2$. To parametrize the loop, we use the parametric equations $x = 1 + 2\cos \theta$ and $y = 1 + 2\sin \theta$, where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$. 



We then find $\mathrm{d}x$ and $\mathrm{d}y$ in terms of $\theta$: 



\begin{align*}

\mathrm{d}x &= -2\sin \theta \mathrm{d}\theta,\\

\mathrm{d}y &= 2\cos \theta \mathrm{d}\theta.

\end{align*}



Now, we rewrite the integral using these parametric representations:



\begin{align*}

\oint_{L} \frac{x \mathrm{d} y-y\mathrm{d} x}{x^2+y^2} &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{(1+2\cos \theta)(2\cos \theta)(2\cos \theta) - (1+2\sin \theta)(-2\sin \theta)}{(1+2\cos \theta)^2+(1+2\sin \theta)^2} \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{(2\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta) + (2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta)}{4+8\cos \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 8\sin \theta + 4\sin^2 \theta + 8\sin \theta \cos \theta} \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta}{8 + 8\sin \theta \cos \theta + 4(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta)} \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta}{12} \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta}{12} \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

\end{align*}



To solve this integral, we break it into several parts and use the trigonometric identities $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$, $\cos(3\theta) = \cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta \sin^2 \theta$, and $\sin(3\theta) = 3\cos^2 \theta \sin \theta - \sin^3 \theta$:



\begin{align*}

& \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4\sin^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4(1 - \cos^2 \theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4\cos^3 \theta + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta - 4 + 4\cos^2 \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4\cos^3 \theta + 8\cos^2 \theta + 2\cos \theta + 2\sin \theta + 2\sin^3 \theta - 4 \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 2\cos(3\theta) + 8(1 + \cos(2\theta)) + 2\sin(3\theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta - 4 \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 2\cos(3\theta) + 8 + 8\cos(2\theta) + 2\sin(3\theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta - 4 \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4 + 8\cos(2\theta) + 2\cos(3\theta) + 2\sin(3\theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{2\pi} 4 + 8\cos(2\theta) + 2\cos(3\theta) + 2\sin(3\theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta \mathrm{d}\theta\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \left[ 4\theta + 8 \cdot \frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\sin(3\theta)}{3} + 2\sin^3 \theta \right]_{0}^{2\pi}\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \left[ 4\theta + 4 \sin(2\theta) + \frac{2}{3} \sin(3\theta) + 2\sin^3 \theta \right]_{0}^{2\pi}\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \left[ (4 \cdot 2\pi) + 4 \sin(2 \cdot 2\pi) + \frac{2}{3} \sin(3 \cdot 2\pi) + 2\sin^3 (2\pi) - (4 \cdot 0) - 4 \sin(2 \cdot 0) - \frac{2}{3} \sin(3 \cdot 0) - 2\sin^3 (0) \right]\\

&= \frac{1}{12} \left[ 8\pi + 0 + 0 - 0 \right]\\

&= \boxed{\frac{2\pi}{3}}\\

**Question in Chinese**: 计算沿回路$L:(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$逆时针方向的积分: $\oint_{L}  \frac{x \mathrm{d} y-y\mathrm{d} x}{x^2+y^2} $。

**Question in English**: Calculate the integral along the loop $L:(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$ counterclockwise:$\oint_{L}  \frac{x \mathrm{d} y-y\mathrm{d} x}{x^2+y^2} $.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we can use the Green's theorem, which states that for a simple closed curve $C$ enclosing a region $R$, the following holds:



$$\oint_{C} (Pdx + Qdy) = \iint_{R} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)dxdy$$



However, we first need to determine the region $R$ that the curve $L:(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$ encloses. The equation $(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$ represents a circle with radius $r=2$, centered at $(1,1)$.



Since the integral is to be evaluated counterclockwise, we'll use the parametric equations for this circle: $x=1+2\cos\theta$ and $y=1+2\sin\theta$, where $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$.



Now we can substitute the parametric equations into the original integral. We'll have $\mathrm{d}x=-2\sin\theta\mathrm{d}\theta$ and $\mathrm{d}y=2\cos\theta\mathrm{d}\theta$. Thus, our integral becomes:



$$\oint_{L} \frac{x\mathrm{d}y - y\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+y^2} = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{(1+2\cos\theta)(2\cos\theta) - (1+2\sin\theta)(-2\sin\theta)}{(1+2\cos\theta)^2 + (1+2\sin\theta)^2} \mathrm{d}\theta$$



However, applying Green's theorem, we first need to evaluate the partial derivatives of $P = -y$ and $Q = x$, thus the region can be parameterized by $x=1+2\cos\theta$ and $y=1+2\sin\theta$. After some manipulations we obtain $\iint_{R} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)dxdy=\iint_{R} 1 dxdy = Area (R)$. So $R$ is the region enclosed by the circle $(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4$.





Thus, Area $(R) = \pi \times 4^2=16\pi$. However, to use Green's theorem, we still need to evaluate $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}$. We have that $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 1$ and $\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=-1$. Therefore $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=2$. Hence our answer is:



\boxed{32\pi}.

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the integral, we'll use Green's theorem. However, we first need to parameterize the curve.



Given the equation of the loop:

$$ (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 4 $$

This represents a circle centered at (1,1) with a radius of 2.



We can parameterize it as follows:

$$ x = 1 + 2 \cos t $$

$$ y = 1 + 2 \sin t $$

Here, we use the standard parametric equations of a circle.



We need to calculate the derivatives of x and y with respect to t:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} = -2 \sin t $$

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} t} = 2 \cos t $$



Now, let's write the line integral in terms of t:

$$ \oint_L \frac{x \mathrm{d} y - y \mathrm{d} x}{x^2 + y^2} $$



Substituting x and y:

$$ \oint_L \frac{(1 + 2 \cos t)(2 \cos t) - (1 + 2 \sin t)(-2 \sin t)}{(1 + 2 \cos t)^2 + (1 + 2 \sin t)^2} \mathrm{d} t $$



Simplifying the expression:

$$ \oint_L \frac{2 \cos^2 t + 4 \cos^2 t + 2 \sin t \cos t + 2 \sin^2 t}{4 + 4 \cos 2t + 4 \sin^2 t + 4 \cos^2 t} \mathrm{d} t $$



$$ = \oint_L \frac{6 \cos^2 t + 2 \sin t \cos t}{8 + 4 \cos 2t} \mathrm{d} t $$



However, using Green's theorem simplifies this process significantly.



The circle can be represented as $C_1$ and $C_2$ where $C_1$ is $y = 2 \sin t$, $x = 2 \cos t$ and $y = 1, x = 1$ (top of circle), and $C_2$ is the line connecting the top circle to its left side: $y = 2 \sin t$, $x = -3$; $y = -1$, $x = 1$.



Our original curve has to be traversed counterclockwise. So $C_1$ is traversed clockwise.



However, we can make a mistake in calculating the value of the line integral as we need to calculate the curl (determinant of the 2x2 matrix of the vector field of the differential of the vector field in its parametric form).



$\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}$ = $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}[\frac{ -y}{x^2+y^2}]$ - $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}]$



$= -\frac{1}{x^2+y^2} - (-\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^2})(2x) = -\frac{1}{x^2+y^2} + \frac{2x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$



$= \frac{-(x^2+y^2)+2x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$



$= \frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$



Since our curve can be parameterized using $(2 \cos t, 2 \sin t)$ for $C_2$, our line integral can now be evaluated as the area of the circle (where curl value is integrated around the loop). We use a general method for double integral $\int\int_A \frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}dA$ to solve this problem.



However, in our case, we have to use the double integral formula to calculate this.



$\int\int_A\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}dA$ = $\int_{0}^{2\pi}[\int_{r=0}^{r=2} \frac{r^2(\cos^2t - \sin^2t)}{r^4} r dr]dt$



= $\int_{0}^{2\pi}[\int_{0}^{2} \frac{\cos^2t - \sin^2t}{r^2} dr]dt$



= $\int_{0}^{2\pi}[\frac{1}{r}(\frac{\cos^2t - \sin^2t}{r})\vert_{0}^{2}]dt$



= $\int_{0}^{2\pi}(\frac{\cos^2t - \sin^2t}{2})dt$



= $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\cos^2tdt - \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sin^2tdt$



Using the trigonometric identities

$\cos(2t) = 2\cos^2t - 1$

and

$\sin(2t) = 2\sin t \cos t$



$\cos^2t = (1 + \cos(2t))/2$



and

$\sin^2t = (1 - \cos(2t))/2$



The equation simplifies to



$\int_{0}^{2\pi}[(1 + \cos(2t))/2]dt - \frac{1}{2}[\int_{0}^{2\pi}(1 - \cos(2t))/2]dt$



= $\int_{0}^{2\pi}(1/2)dt + \int_{0}^{2\pi}(\cos(2t)/2)dt - \frac{1}{2}[\int_{0}^{2\pi}(1/2)dt - \int_{0}^{2\pi}(\cos(2t)/2)dt]$



= $(\frac{1}{2}t)\vert_{0}^{2\pi} + \frac{1}{2}(\sin(2t)/2)\vert_{0}^{2\pi} - \frac{1}{4}(t)\vert_{0}^{2\pi} + \frac{1}{4}(\sin(2t)/2)\vert_{0}^{2\pi}$



= $\pi + 0 - \frac{\pi}{2} + 0$



= $\frac{\pi}{2}$



However, the direction is counterclockwise. However, this can be changed by multiplying the result by -1 as the area is positive when traversed clockwise.



Thus, the line integral is $\boxed{-\frac{\pi}{2}}$.

**Question in English**: A set of observations $(x,y): (-0.72,-0.061),(0.88,1.55),(-1.94,-0.97),(-0.87,-0.42),(0.083,0.55),(0.54,0.93),(-0.71,-0.23),(- 2.55,-1.61),(1.98,2.02),(0.54,0.73)$, and the random error term follows a normal distribution with unknown variance, find the empirical linear regression equation.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the empirical linear regression equation, we will follow these steps:



1. **Compute the means of x and y:**



   We first need to find the mean of x and y. 



   The mean of x is: $\bar{x} = \frac{-0.72+0.88-1.94-0.87+0.083+0.54-0.71-2.55+1.98+0.54}{10} = -0.38$



   The mean of y is: $\bar{y} = \frac{-0.061+1.55-0.97-0.42+0.55+0.93-0.23-1.61+2.02+0.73}{10} = 0.52$



2. **Compute the deviations of x and y from their means:**



   Now, we need to compute the deviations of x and y from their means.



   Let's denote the deviations as $x_i - \bar{x}$ and $y_i - \bar{y}$.



   We calculate these deviations for each observation and store them in the following tables.



   | x      | x - x̄     | y       | y - ȳ    |

   |--------|------------|---------|----------|

   | -0.72  | -0.02      | -0.061  | -0.58    |

   | 0.88   | 1.22       | 1.55    | 1.03     |

   | -1.94  | -1.66      | -0.97   | -1.49    |

   | -0.87  | -0.48      | -0.42   | -0.7     |

   | 0.083  | 1.41       | 0.55    | 0.03     |

   | 0.54   | 1.92       | 0.93    | 0.41     |

   | -0.71  | -1.08      | -0.23   | -0.79    |

   | -2.55  | -2.92      | -1.61   | -0.69    |

   | 1.98   | 3.4        | 2.02    | 1.5      |

   | 0.54   | 2.92       | 0.73    | 0.21     |



3. **Compute the covariance and the variance:**



   We now compute the covariance and the variance.



   Let $C_{xy} = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ and $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.



   $C_{xy} = (-0.02)(-0.58) + (1.22)(1.03) + (-1.66)(-1.49) + (-0.48)(-0.7) + (1.41)(0.03) + (1.92)(0.41) + (-1.08)(-0.79) + (-2.92)(-0.69) + (3.4)(1.5) + (2.92)(0.21)$

   $C_{xy} = 0.0116 + 1.2626 + 2.4724 + 0.336 + 0.0423 + 0.7848 + 0.8472 + 2.0148 + 5.1 + 0.61272 = 13.1948$



   $\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = (-0.02)^2 + (1.22)^2 + (-1.66)^2 + (-0.48)^2 + (1.41)^2 + (1.92)^2 + (-1.08)^2 + (-2.92)^2 + (3.4)^2 + (2.92)^2$

   $\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 0.0004 + 1.4884 + 2.7516 + 0.2304 + 1.9849 + 3.6864 + 1.1664 + 8.5216 + 11.56 + 8.5 = 39.82$



   $s^2 = \frac{39.82}{10 - 1} = 4.08$



4. **Compute the slope (b1):**



   We use the formula $b_1 = \frac{C_{xy}}{s^2} = \frac{13.1948}{4.08} = 3.23$



5. **Compute the intercept (b0):**



   We use the formula $b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x} = 0.52 - (3.23)(-0.38) = 1.54$



Therefore, the empirical linear regression equation is $y = 3.23x + 1.54$.

To find the empirical linear regression equation, we need to follow these steps:



1.  Calculate the mean of x (x̄) and y (ȳ).

2.  Calculate the deviations from the mean for x and y.

3.  Calculate the slope (b1) and intercept (b0) of the regression line.



Let's calculate the mean of x (x̄) and y (ȳ):



x = (-0.72, 0.88, -1.94, -0.87, 0.083, 0.54, -0.71, -2.55, 1.98, 0.54)

y = (-0.061, 1.55, -0.97, -0.42, 0.55, 0.93, -0.23, -1.61, 2.02, 0.73)



x̄ = (-0.720 + 0.88 - 1.94 - 0.87 + 0.083 + 0.54 - 0.71 - 2.55 + 1.98 + 0.54) / 10 = -0.847

ȳ = (-0.061 + 1.55 - 0.97 - 0.42 + 0.55 + 0.93 - 0.23 - 1.61 + 2.02 + 0.73) / 10 = 0.5295



Now, let's calculate the deviations from the mean for x and y:



deviations_x = (-0.720 - (-0.847), 0.88 - (-0.847), -1.94 - (-0.847), -0.87 - (-0.847), 0.083 - (-0.847), 0.54 - (-0.847), -0.71 - (-0.847), -2.55 - (-0.847), 1.98 - (-0.847), 0.54 - (-0.847))

= (-0.220, 1.727, -0.093, -0.013, 0.93, 1.387, -0.137, -1.703, 2.827, 1.387)



deviations_y = (-0.061 - 0.5295, 1.55 - 0.5295, -0.97 - 0.5295, -0.42 - 0.5295, 0.55 - 0.5295, 0.93 - 0.5295, -0.23 - 0.5295, -1.61 - 0.5295, 2.02 - 0.5295, 0.73 - 0.5295)

= (-0.5905, 1.0205, -1.4995, -0.9495, 0.0205, 0.4005, -0.7595, -2.1395, 1.4905, 0.2005)



Now, let's calculate the slope (b1) and intercept (b0) of the regression line.



b1 = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)²



b1 = ( (-0.220)(-0.5905) + (1.727)(1.0205) + (-0.093)(-1.4995) + (-0.013)(-0.9495) + (0.93)(0.0205) + (1.387)(0.4005) + (-0.137)(-0.7595) + (-1.703)(-2.1395) + (2.827)(1.4905) + (1.387)(0.2005) ) / ( (-0.220)² + (1.727)² + (-0.093)² + (-0.013)² + (0.93)² + (1.387)² + (-0.137)² + (-1.703)² + (2.827)² + (1.387)² )



b1 ≈ 2.0489 / 15.131

b1 ≈ 0.1356



b0 = ȳ - b1x̄

b0 ≈ 0.5295 - (0.1356)(-0.847)

b0 ≈ 0.5295 + 0.1148

b0 ≈ 0.6443



Therefore, the empirical linear regression equation is:

**Question in English**: A set of observations $(x,y): (-0.72,-0.061),(0.88,1.55),(-1.94,-0.97),(-0.87,-0.42),(0.083,0.55),(0.54,0.93),(-0.71,-0.23),(- 2.55,-1.61),(1.98,2.02),(0.54,0.73)$, and the random error term follows a normal distribution with unknown variance, find the empirical linear regression equation.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the empirical linear regression equation, we need to calculate the following:



1. The mean of x and y

2. The slope of the regression line (b1)

3. The intercept of the regression line (b0)



**Step 1: Calculate the mean of x and y**



Let's denote the observations as (x1, y1), (x2, y2),..., (xn, yn).



The mean of x is given by:



x̄ = (x1 + x2 +... + xn) / n



The mean of y is given by:



ȳ = (y1 + y2 +... + yn) / n



Here's the calculation:



x̄ = (-0.72 + 0.88 - 1.94 - 0.87 + 0.083 + 0.54 - 0.71 - 2.55 + 1.98 + 0.54) / 10

= -4.75 / 10

= -0.475



ȳ = (-0.061 + 1.55 - 0.97 - 0.42 + 0.55 + 0.93 - 0.23 - 1.61 + 2.02 + 0.73) / 10

= 2.41 / 10

= 0.241



**Step 2: Calculate the slope of the regression line (b1)**



The slope of the regression line is given by:



b1 = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)²



Let's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:



Numerator: 

Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] 

= (-0.72 - 0.475)(-0.061 - 0.241) + (0.88 - 0.475)(1.55 - 0.241) + (-1.94 - 0.475)(-0.97 - 0.241) + (-0.87 - 0.475)(-0.42 - 0.241) + (0.083 - 0.475)(0.55 - 0.241) + (0.54 - 0.475)(0.93 - 0.241) + (-0.71 - 0.475)(-0.23 - 0.241) + (-2.55 - 0.475)(-1.61 - 0.241) + (1.98 - 0.475)(2.02 - 0.241) + (0.54 - 0.475)(0.73 - 0.241)

= 0.0483 + 0.649 + 1.155 + 0.463 + -0.158 + 0.357 + 0.169 + 2.449 + 2.047 + 0.263

= 7.482



Denominator:

Σ(xi - x̄)² 

= (-0.72 - 0.475)² + (0.88 - 0.475)² + (-1.94 - 0.475)² + (-0.87 - 0.475)² + (0.083 - 0.475)² + (0.54 - 0.475)² + (-0.71 - 0.475)² + (-2.55 - 0.475)² + (1.98 - 0.475)² + (0.54 - 0.475)²

= 0.4925 + 0.361 + 5.419 + 0.863 + 0.336 + 0.001 + 0.731 + 7.025 + 3.192 + 0.001

= 18.621



Now, we can calculate the slope:



b1 = 7.482 / 18.621

= 0.402



**Step 3: Calculate the intercept of the regression line (b0)**



The intercept of the regression line is given by:



b0 = ȳ - b1x̄



Substituting the values, we get:



b0 = 0.241 - 0.402(-0.475)

= 0.241 + 0.1908

= 0.4318



**Empirical Linear Regression Equation:**



y = b0 + b1x

= 0.4318 + 0.402x



Therefore, the empirical linear regression equation is y = 0.4318 + 0.402x.

**Question in Chinese**: 令$X$服从自由度为$n\,(n\ge 2)$的t分布，求$X$的期望$EX$。

**Question in English**: Let $X$ obey the t-distribution with degrees of freedom $n\,(n\ge 2)$ and find the expectation $EX$ of $X$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the expectation $EX$ of $X$, we need to recall the properties of the t-distribution.



The t-distribution is defined as:



$$t = \frac{X}{S/\sqrt{n}}$$



where $X$ is a standard normal random variable, $S$ is a chi-square random variable with $n$ degrees of freedom, and $n$ is the sample size.



We can rewrite the t-distribution as:



$$X = \frac{tS}{\sqrt{n}}$$



We can find the expectation of $X$ by taking the expectation of both sides:



$$EX = E\left[\frac{tS}{\sqrt{n}}\right]$$



We can use the linearity of expectation to break it down into two separate expectations:



$$EX = E[t]E[S]$$



Now, we need to find the expectations of $t$ and $S$.



The expectation of a standard normal random variable $X$ is 0, and the expectation of a chi-square random variable $S$ with $n$ degrees of freedom is $n$.



The expectation of $t$ is not 0, however. It can be found by using the definition of $t$ and the expectations of $X$ and $S$:



$$Et = \frac{EX}{E[S/\sqrt{n}]}$$



Since $E[S] = n$, we have:



$$E[S/\sqrt{n}] = n/\sqrt{n} = \sqrt{n}$$



Now, we can plug this into the expression for $Et$:



$$Et = \frac{EX}{E[S/\sqrt{n}]} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{n}} = 0$$



Now that we have found $Et = 0$, we can plug this back into the expression for $EX$:



$$EX = E[t]E[S] = 0 \cdot n = 0$$



So, the expectation of $X$ is $EX = 0$.

**Question in Chinese**: 令$X$服从自由度为$n\,(n\ge 2)$的t分布，求$X$的期望$EX$。

**Question in English**: Let $X$ obey the t-distribution with degrees of freedom $n\,(n\ge 2)$ and find the expectation $EX$ of $X$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the expectation $EX$ of $X$, we need to find the mean of the t-distribution.



The t-distribution is symmetric around its mean. The mean of the t-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom is 0 if $n>1$.



To show that the mean of the t-distribution is 0, we can use the fact that the t-distribution is defined as:



$$t(n) = \frac{T(n)}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(T_i - \bar{T})^2}}$$



where $T(n)$ is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance $n-1$ and $\bar{T}$ is the sample mean of $T_i$'s.



Taking the expectation of both sides, we get:



$$E[t(n)] = E\left[\frac{T(n)}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(T_i - \bar{T})^2}}\right]$$



Since $T(n)$ and $\bar{T}$ are independent, we can write:



$$E[t(n)] = E\left[\frac{E[T(n)]}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(E[T_i] - E[\bar{T}])^2}}\right]$$



Since $T(n)$ is a normal random variable with mean 0, we have:



$$E[T(n)] = 0$$



Similarly, we have:



$$E[T_i] = E[\bar{T}] = 0$$



Therefore, we have:



$$E[t(n)] = E\left[\frac{0}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(0 - 0)^2}}\right] = 0$$



So, the mean of the t-distribution is 0.



Therefore, the expectation $EX$ of $X$ is:



$$EX = 0$$

**Question in Chinese**: 令$X$服从自由度为$n\,(n\ge 2)$的t分布，求$X$的期望$EX$。

**Question in English**: Let $X$ obey the t-distribution with degrees of freedom $n\,(n\ge 2)$ and find the expectation $EX$ of $X$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the expectation $EX$ of $X$, we can use the following steps:



1. Recall the definition of the t-distribution with degrees of freedom $n$. It is defined as:



$$f(x; n) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{n\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{n}\right)^{-\frac{n+1}{2}}$$



2. The expectation $EX$ can be found using the following formula:



$$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\,f(x; n)\,dx$$



3. To evaluate this integral, we can make a substitution: let $u = 1 + \frac{x^2}{n}$. Then, $du = \frac{2x}{n}\,dx$, or equivalently, $x\,dx = \frac{n}{2}\,du$. The limits of integration remain the same.



4. Substituting these expressions into the integral, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{n\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} u^{-\frac{n+1}{2}} du$$



5. We can further simplify the integral by canceling the $\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)$ terms:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{n\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} \int_{1}^{\infty} u^{-\frac{n+1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} du$$



6. Simplifying the exponent of the integral, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\pi}} \int_{1}^{\infty} u^{-\frac{n}{2}} du$$



7. We can evaluate the integral using the power rule of integration:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\pi}} \cdot \frac{-u^{-\frac{n}{2}+1}}{-\frac{n}{2}+1} \Bigg\vert_{1}^{\infty}$$



8. Evaluating the limits of integration, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\pi}} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{n-2}{2}}$$



9. Simplifying the expression, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n\pi}\,(n-2)}$$



10. Simplifying further, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{n}{n-2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$$



11. Simplifying further, we get:



$$E[X] = \frac{n\sqrt{\pi n}}{n-2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$$



$$E[X] = \frac{2n}{n-2}$$



But this isn't correct, the correct answer is given by:



$$E[X] = 0$$



This is because $X$ follows a t-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom, and as $n$ approaches infinity, the t-distribution approaches a normal distribution, and the mean of a normal distribution is zero.



$\boxed{0}$

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$的极大值。

**Question in English**: Find the local maximum of the function $f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the local maximum of the function $f(x) = x^4(x-1)^3$, we need to follow these steps:



1. **Find the derivative of the function**: 

   $$f'(x) = 4x^3(x-1)^3 + x^4 \cdot 3(x-1)^2.$$

   Using the chain rule and the product rule, we get: 

   $$f'(x) = x^3(x-1)^2(4(x-1)+3).$$



2. **Simplify the derivative**:

   $$f'(x) = x^3(x-1)^2(7-x).$$



3. **Find critical points**: Critical points are where $f'(x) = 0$. 

   Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get:

   $$x^3(x-1)^2(7-x) = 0.$$

   Solving for $x$, we get:

   $$x = 0, \ x = 1, \text{ or } \ x = 7.$$



4. **Find the second derivative**:

   $$f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[x^3(x-1)^2(7-x)].$$

   Using the product rule, we get: 

   $$f''(x) = [3x^2(x-1)^2(7-x)] + [2x^3(x-1)(7-x)] + [x^3(x-1)^2 \cdot (-1)].$$



5. **Simplify the second derivative**:

   $$f''(x) = x^2(x-1)^2(21-9x+3x^2) + 2x^3(x-1)(7-x) - x^3(x-1)^2.$$



6. **Determine intervals of increase and decrease**: 

   We will test the sign of $f''(x)$ in the intervals $(-\infty,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,7)$, and $(7,\infty)$.



7. **Perform the sign test**: After testing the sign of $f''(x)$, we get: 

   * $(-\infty,0)$: All factors positive, so $f''(x) > 0$.

   * $(0,1)$: $x^2(x-1)^2 > 0$ and $21-9x+3x^2 < 0$, so $f''(x) < 0$.

   * $(1,7)$: $21-9x+3x^2 < 0$, so $f''(x) < 0$.

   * $(7,\infty)$: All factors positive, so $f''(x) > 0$.



8. **Determine local maximum**: From the sign test, we see that $f''(x) < 0$ in the intervals $(0,1)$ and $(1,7)$. This means $f(x)$ is concave down in these intervals, and we should test the critical points. We already know that $f(x)$ is not concave down at $x=0$, $x=1$ or $x=7$.



9. **Determine whether a point is a local maxima or minima**: The critical point that is a local maximum should have $f''(x)$ change from positive to negative at that point, or $f''(x)$ is positive on one side and negative on the other side. Since $f''(x) < 0$ for both $x=0,1$, we conclude that one of the two is a local minimum.



Now, to determine which one, plug the critical points into $f(x)$. We know, f(x) = x^4(x-1)^3. Using this, f'(x) is defined at 0 but undefined at x=7. However, at 7 we find a horizontal asymptote for the given function f(x) by solving lim x->inf f(x), f(7) gives us f(x) value of zero, for which the given equation of the function, has no local maxima. Therefore, the local maxima for f(x) is between the interval (0,1). Since f''(x) is less than zero between interval (0,1), we check at 1. To confirm this, find the limit of the difference quotient of the function, (f(h)-f(0))/h where h approaches 0 from the right and from the left. As h approaches 0 from the right f(h) gives a local maxima when f'(x) > 0 for x=1 which is a local maxima since f(x) is continuous, differentiable at x=1.



Therefore, $\boxed{1}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$的极大值。

**Question in English**: Find the local maximum of the function $f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the local maximum of the function $f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$, we need to follow these steps:



1. Find the critical points: 

We need to find the values of x that make the derivative of the function equal to zero or undefined. 



First, let's expand the function:



$f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3=x^4(x^3-3x^2+3x-1)=x^7-3x^6+3x^5-x^4$



Now, let's find the derivative of the function using the power rule:



$f'(x)=7x^6-18x^5+15x^4-4x^3$



To find the critical points, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:



$7x^6-18x^5+15x^4-4x^3=0$



We can factor out an x^3 from all the terms:



$x^3(7x^3-18x^2+15x-4)=0$



This tells us that either $x^3=0$ or $7x^3-18x^2+15x-4=0$.



Solving $x^3=0$ gives us x=0.



To solve $7x^3-18x^2+15x-4=0$, we can try to factor the expression:



After factoring, we get:



$(x-1)(7x^2-11x+4)=0$



This gives us two possible solutions: x=1 and the solutions to the quadratic equation $7x^2-11x+4=0$.



Using the quadratic formula, we can find the solutions to the quadratic equation:



$x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{(-11)^2-4(7)(4)}}{2(7)}$



$x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{121-112}}{14}$



$x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{9}}{14}$



$x=\frac{11 \pm 3}{14}$



This gives us two more possible solutions: x=1 and $x=\frac{7}{7}=1$ or $x=\frac{8}{14}=\frac{4}{7}$.



2. Identify local maxima:



We have found three critical points: x=0, x=1, and $x=\frac{4}{7}$. To identify which of these points corresponds to a local maximum, we need to examine the sign of the derivative on either side of each critical point.



For x=0, we can evaluate the derivative at x=0.1 and x=-0.1:



$f'(0.1)=7(0.1)^6-18(0.1)^5+15(0.1)^4-4(0.1)^3=0.000067-0.000018+0.000015-0.000004=0.00006$



$f'(-0.1)=7(-0.1)^6-18(-0.1)^5+15(-0.1)^4-4(-0.1)^3=0.000067+0.000018-0.000015+0.000004=0.000074$



Since the derivative is positive on both sides of x=0, we know that x=0 is not a local maximum.



For x=1, we can evaluate the derivative at x=0.9 and x=1.1:



$f'(0.9)=7(0.9)^6-18(0.9)^5+15(0.9)^4-4(0.9)^3=-0.000006-0.000042-0.000108+0.000072=-0.000084$



$f'(1.1)=7(1.1)^6-18(1.1)^5+15(1.1)^4-4(1.1)^3=0.000061-0.000084+0.000135-0.000121=0$



Since the derivative is negative on one side of x=1, we know that x=1 is a local maximum.



For $x=\frac{4}{7}$, we can evaluate the derivative at $x=\frac{4}{7}+0.01$ and $x=\frac{4}{7}-0.01$:



Since $x=\frac{4}{7}$ is not a local maximum or minimum for $f(x)$ and $x=0$ is not a local maximum, $x=\frac{4}{7}$ can't be a maximum of a concave down function, we can conclude that the local maximum is $x=1$.



So the local maximum is $\boxed{x=1}$.

**Question in Chinese**: 求函数$f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$的极大值。

**Question in English**: Find the local maximum of the function $f(x)=x^4(x-1)^3$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the local maximum of the function f(x) = x^4(x-1)^3, we need to find the critical points of the function.



Step 1: Find the derivative of the function

To find the critical points, we need to find the derivative of the function. Using the product rule and chain rule of differentiation, we get:



f'(x) = d/dx [x^4(x-1)^3]

= d/dx [x^4] * (x-1)^3 + x^4 * d/dx [(x-1)^3]

= 4x^3(x-1)^3 + x^4 * 3(x-1)^2 * d/dx [x-1]

= 4x^3(x-1)^3 + x^4 * 3(x-1)^2



Simplifying the derivative, we get:

f'(x) = 4x^3(x-1)^3 + 3x^4(x-1)^2



Step 2: Find the critical points

Critical points are the values of x for which the derivative is equal to zero or undefined. Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:



4x^3(x-1)^3 + 3x^4(x-1)^2 = 0



Factoring out the common term (x-1)^2, we get:



(x-1)^2 (4x^3 + 3x^4) = 0



Now, we can see that (x-1)^2 is always non-negative, so the term (4x^3 + 3x^4) must be equal to zero. Factoring out the common term x^3, we get:



x^3 (4 + 3x) = 0



Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:



x^3 = 0 => x = 0

4 + 3x = 0 => 3x = -4 => x = -4/3



Step 3: Check for local maximum

Now that we have found the critical points, we need to check if they correspond to a local maximum. We can use the second derivative test to check this.



Step 4: Find the second derivative

Using the product rule and chain rule of differentiation again, we get:



f''(x) = d/dx [4x^3(x-1)^3 + 3x^4(x-1)^2]

= 12x^2(x-1)^3 + 4x^3 * 3(x-1)^2 * d/dx [x-1] + 3x^4 * 2(x-1) * d/dx [x-1] + 3x^4(x-1)^2

= 12x^2(x-1)^3 + 12x^3(x-1)^2 + 6x^4(x-1)



Simplifying the second derivative, we get:



f''(x) = 12x^2(x-1)^3 + 12x^3(x-1)^2 + 6x^4(x-1)



Step 5: Apply the second derivative test

Now that we have found the second derivative, we can use the second derivative test to check if the critical points correspond to a local maximum. If the second derivative is negative at a critical point, then the critical point corresponds to a local maximum.



Let's check the critical points:



* x = 0: f''(0) = 0, so the second derivative test is inconclusive.

* x = -4/3: f''(-4/3) = 12(-4/3)^2((4/3)-1)^3 + 12(-4/3)^3((4/3)-1)^2 + 6(-4/3)^4((4/3)-1)

= 12(16/9)(-1/3)^3 + 12(-64/27)(-1/3)^2 + 6(256/81)(-1/3)

= 64/81 - 64/81 - 512/243

= -64/243 * (3/4) 

= -16/81, since second derivative is negative, so x = -4/3 corresponds to a local maximum.



Therefore, the local maximum of the function f(x) = x^4(x-1)^3 occurs at x = -4/3.

**Question in English**: Calculate:$\int_{0}^{1} e^x\mathrm{dx}$.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the integral $\int_{0}^{1} e^x\mathrm{dx}$, we'll use the property of exponential functions and the basic rules of integration.



1. Identify the integral as the antiderivative of $e^x$. 



The antiderivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$ itself. This can be proven using the definition of a derivative, and the fact that $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$.



2. Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower bounds of integration. 



The antiderivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$, so:



$ \int_{0}^{1} e^x\mathrm{dx} = [e^x]_{0}^{1} = e^1 - e^0 $



3. Simplify the expression. 



Since $e^0$ is equal to $1$, and $e^1$ is equal to $e$, we have:



$ e^1 - e^0 = e - 1 $



Therefore, $\int_{0}^{1} e^x\mathrm{dx} = e - 1$.

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the integral, we will use the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fact that the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$.



Step 1: Define the function and its derivative.

The function is $f(x) = e^x$ and its derivative is also $f'(x) = e^x$.



Step 2: Integrate the function from 0 to 1.

We can integrate $f(x)$ using the fundamental theorem of calculus:



$\int_{0}^{1} e^x\mathrm{dx} = \left[e^x\right]_{0}^{1}$



Step 3: Evaluate the result at the bounds.

We need to evaluate $e^x$ at the bounds of the integral, which are 0 and 1.



$\left[e^x\right]_{0}^{1} = e^1 - e^0$



Step 4: Calculate the values of $e^1$ and $e^0$.

We know that $e^1 = e$ and $e^0 = 1$.



$e^1 - e^0 = e - 1$



Therefore, the final answer is:



$\boxed{e - 1}$

**Question in Chinese**: 圆O的半径为5，弦AB的长度为8。求从圆心O到弦AB的距离。

**Question in English**: The radius of the circle O is 5 and the length of the chord AB is 8. Find the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB, we can use the formula for the distance from the center of a circle to a chord, which is given by:



d = √(r² - (b/2)²)



where d is the distance, r is the radius of the circle, and b is the length of the chord.



Given that the radius of the circle O is 5 and the length of the chord AB is 8, we can substitute these values into the formula:



d = √(5² - (8/2)²)

d = √(25 - (4)²)

d = √(25 - 16)

d = √9

d = 3



Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB is 3 units.

**Question in Chinese**: 圆O的半径为5，弦AB的长度为8。求从圆心O到弦AB的距离。

**Question in English**: The radius of the circle O is 5 and the length of the chord AB is 8. Find the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the distance from the center of the circle to the chord, we can use the formula for the length of the median to the chord, which is also the distance from the center of the circle to the chord. This formula involves the radius of the circle and the length of the chord.



First, draw a diagram of the situation:



In this diagram, let M be the midpoint of the chord AB. The length of AM (or BM) is half the length of AB, which is 8/2 = 4.



Next, draw a perpendicular line from O to AB, meeting AB at point P.



Let's use the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle OMP to find the distance OP.



According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (OM) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (OP and MP).



We know the length of OM is 5 (the radius of the circle), and the length of MP is 4 (half the length of AB). 



Let's denote the length of OP as x.



Then the Pythagorean theorem gives:



5^2 = x^2 + 4^2

25 = x^2 + 16



Now, let's solve for x:



x^2 = 25 - 16

x^2 = 9



x = √9

x = 3



So the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB is 3.



Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{3}

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this problem, we'll use the following steps:



1. Draw the diagram:

   The center of the circle is O, and the radius is 5. We draw the chord AB, and let the point of intersection between the line passing through the center O and the chord AB be M.



2. Draw the perpendicular bisector of the chord AB, and let it intersect with the circle at point P.

   In the right triangle OMP, the radius OP is 5, and half of the chord AB is 4 (half of 8).



3. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance OM:

   Let's denote the distance OM as x. Then, in the right triangle OMP, we have:

   x^2 + 4^2 = 5^2

   x^2 + 16 = 25

   x^2 = 25 - 16

   x^2 = 9

   x = sqrt(9) = 3



Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle O to the chord AB is 3.



\boxed{3}

**Question in Chinese**: 解线性方程组x+y+z=6, x-y+2z=5, 3x-y-z=-2。

**Question in English**: Solve the system of linear equations x+y+z=6, x-y+2z=5, 3x-y-z=-2.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.



First, we will convert the system of equations into a matrix form:



| 1  1  1 |   | x  |   | 6  |

| 1 -1  2 |   | y  |   | 5  |

| 3 -1 -1 |   | z  |   | -2 |



Next, we will perform row operations to make the matrix easier to solve.



Step 1: Multiply the first row by -1 and add it to the second row:



| 1  1  1 |   | x  |   | 6  |

| 0  0  1 |   |   |   | 1  |

| 3 -1 -1 |   |   |   | -2 |



Step 2: Multiply the first row by -3 and add it to the third row:



| 1  1  1 |   | x  |   | 6  |

| 0  0  1 |   |   |   | 1  |

| 0 -4 -4 |   |   |   | -20 |



Step 3: Multiply the second row by -1 and add it to the third row:



| 1  1  1 |   | x  |   | 6  |

| 0  0  1 |   |   |   | 1  |

| 0  0  0 |   |   |   | -19 |



Now, we have a matrix with a row of zeros, which means that the system has no unique solution.



However, we can write one variable in terms of the other variable using the second row:



1z = 1



z = 1



Now, substitute this value of z in the first equation:



x + y + 1 = 6



x + y = 5



Now, substitute this value of z in the second equation:



x - y + 2(1) = 5



x - y = 3



Now we have a system with two equations and two unknowns:



x + y = 5

x - y = 3



We can solve this system by adding the two equations:



2x = 8



x = 4



Now, substitute this value of x in one of the equations:



4 + y = 5



y = 1



Therefore, the values of x, y, and z are x = 4, y = 1, and z = 1.



\boxed{x = 4, y = 1, z = 1}

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.



Step 1: Write down the equations



1. x + y + z = 6

2. x - y + 2z = 5

3. 3x - y - z = -2



Step 2: Multiply equation 1 by 1 and equation 2 by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same but with opposite signs



1. x + y + z = 6 (no change)

2. x - y + 2z = 5 (multiplied by 1)



Step 3: Add the two equations to eliminate the y variable



(x + y + z) + (x - y + 2z) = 6 + 5

Combine like terms:

2x + 3z = 11



Step 4: Multiply equation 1 by 1 and equation 3 by 3 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same but with opposite signs



1. x + y + z = 6 (no change)

3. 3x - y - z = -2 (multiplied by 3)



Step 5: Multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by -1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same but with opposite signs



1. 3x + 3y + 3z = 18

2. -x + y - 2z = -5



Step 6: Add the two equations to eliminate the x variable



(3x + 3y + 3z) + (-x + y - 2z) = 18 + (-5)

Combine like terms:

2y + z = 13



Step 7: Now we have two new equations:



1. 2x + 3z = 11

2. 2y + z = 13



Step 8: Multiply equation 2 by 3 and equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of z in both equations the same but with opposite signs



1. 4x + 6z = 22

2. 6y + 3z = 39



Step 9: Multiply equation 2 by 2 and equation 1 by -3 to make the coefficients of z in both equations the same but with opposite signs



1. -12x - 18z = -66

2. 12y + 6z = 78



Step 10: Add the two equations to eliminate the z variable



(-12x - 18z) + (12y + 6z) = (-66) + 78

Combine like terms:

12y - 12x = 12



Step 11: Divide both sides of the equation by 12



12y - 12x = 12

y - x = 1



Step 12: Multiply equation 7 by 1 and equation 11 by 1 to eliminate x variable



1. 2y + z = 13 (no change)

2. y - x = 1 (no change)



Step 13: Add the two equations to eliminate x variable



(2y + z) + (y - z) = 13 + 1

Combine like terms:

3y = 14



Step 14: Divide both sides of the equation by 3



3y = 14

y = 14/3

y = 4.67



Step 15: Substitute y = 4.67 in equation 11



y - x = 1

4.67 - x = 1

-x = 1 - 4.67

-x = -3.67

x = 3.67



Step 16: Substitute x = 3.67 and y = 4.67 in equation 1



x + y + z = 6

3.67 + 4.67 + z = 6



Step 17: Subtract 8.34 from both sides of the equation



z = 6 - 8.34

z = -2.34



The final answer is:

\boxed{(3.67, 4.67, -2.34)}

**Question in English**: Solve the system of linear equations x+y+z=6, x-y+2z=5, 3x-y-z=-2.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.



Step 1: We'll start by multiplying the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same.



Equation 1: x + y + z = 6

Equation 2: x - y + 2z = 5



Step 2: Next, we'll add both equations to eliminate the variable y.



(x + y + z) + (x - y + 2z) = 6 + 5

Combine like terms:

2x + 3z = 11



Step 3: We'll keep this new equation and the third equation for now.



New Equation: 2x + 3z = 11

Equation 3: 3x - y - z = -2



Step 4: To eliminate the variable y from the new equation and the third equation, we need to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. We can multiply the new equation by 1 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same.



New Equation: 2x + 3z = 11

Equation 3: 3x - y - z = -2



Step 5: We can multiply the third equation by 1 and the new equation by 1 and add the equations to eliminate the variable y.



(3x - y - z) + (2x + 3z) = -2 + 11

Combine like terms:

5x + 2z = 9



Step 6: We'll keep this new equation for now.



New Equation: 5x + 2z = 9

Original Equation 1: x + y + z = 6



Step 7: To eliminate the variable y from the new equation and the first equation, we need to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. We can multiply the new equation by 1 and the first equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same.



New Equation: 5x + 2z = 9

Original Equation 1: x + y + z = 6



Step 8: We can multiply the first equation by 5 and the new equation by 1 and subtract the new equation from the first equation multiplied by 5 to eliminate the variable y.



(5x + 5y + 5z) - (5x + 2z) = 30 - 9

Combine like terms:

5y + 3z = 21



Step 9: We'll keep this new equation for now.



New Equation: 5y + 3z = 21

Equation 2: x - y + 2z = 5



Step 10: To eliminate the variable y from the new equation and the second equation, we need to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. We can multiply the new equation by 1 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same.



New Equation: 5y + 3z = 21

Equation 2: x - y + 2z = 5



Step 11: We can multiply the new equation by 1 and the second equation by 5 and subtract the new equation from the second equation multiplied by 5 to eliminate the variable y.



(5y + 3z) - (5y - 5z) = 21 - 25

Combine like terms:

8z = -4



Step 12: Now we have the value of z. We can substitute z into the new equation 5x + 2z = 9.



5x + 2(-4/8) = 9

5x - 1/2 = 9



Step 13: We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction.



10x - 1 = 18



Step 14: Now we can add 1 to both sides of the equation.



10x = 19



Step 15: Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for x.



x = 19/10



Now that we have the values of x and z, we can substitute them into one of the original equations to solve for y.



Step 16: We'll substitute x into the first original equation.



(19/10) + y + z = 6

Substitute z = -4/8 = -1/2

(19/10) + y + (-1/2) = 6



Step 17: We can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to get rid of the fraction.



19 + 10y - 5 = 60



Step 18: Now we can add 5 to both sides of the equation.



14 + 10y = 65



Step 19: Now we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation.



10y = 51



Step 20: Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for y.



y = 51/10



So, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 19/10, y = 51/10, and z = -1/2.



\boxed{x = 19/10, y = 51/10, z = -1/2}

**Question in Chinese**: 一个三角形的三边长为7、24、25，求其面积。

**Question in English**: The three sides of a triangle are 7, 24, 25 in length, find its area.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. The formula requires the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is calculated as follows:



1. Find the semi-perimeter (s):

   s = (a + b + c) / 2

   Here, a = 7, b = 24, and c = 25

   s = (7 + 24 + 25) / 2

   s = 56 / 2

   s = 28



2. Apply Heron's formula:

   Area = √(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

   Area = √(28 * (28 - 7) * (28 - 24) * (28 - 25))

   Area = √(28 * 21 * 4 * 3)

   Area = √(7056)

   Area = √(7056) ≈ 84



Therefore, the area of the triangle is approximately 84.

**Question in English**: The three sides of a triangle are 7, 24, 25 in length, find its area.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. The formula requires us to find the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle, which is half of the perimeter (p).



The perimeter (p) of the triangle is the sum of its three sides:

p = 7 + 24 + 25 = 56



Now, we find the semi-perimeter (s):

s = p / 2

s = 56 / 2

s = 28



Heron's formula to find the area (A) of the triangle is:

A = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))



where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle.



Now, let's substitute the values in Heron's formula:

A = √(28(28 - 7)(28 - 24)(28 - 25))

A = √(28 * 21 * 4 * 3)

A = √(7056)

A = √(2 * 3528)

A = √(2 * 2 * 1764)

A = 2√(2 * 2 * 2 * 441)

A = 2 * 2 * √(2 * 2 * 441)

A = 2 * 2 * 2 * √(2 * 21 * 21)

A = 2 * 2 * 2 * 21 * √(2)

A = 2 * 2 * 2 * 21 * √2

A = 2 * 4 * 21 * √2

A = 8 * 21 * √2

A = 168√2

A = 168 * 1.4142  (approximately)

A = 237.2414  (approximately)



The area of the triangle is approximately 237.24 square units.

   Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

   where s is the semi-perimeter and a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle.



4. Substituting the values:

   Area = √(28(28-7)(28-24)(28-25))

   Area = √(28 * 21 * 4 * 3)

   Area = √(7056)

   Area = 84



Therefore, the area of the triangle is 84.

**Question in English**: Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, B=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, calculate A+B.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate A + B, we need to follow the rules of matrix addition. In matrix addition, we add corresponding elements from the two matrices.



Given matrices:

$ A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix} $

$ B=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $



Adding corresponding elements:

- For element at position (1,1): $0 + 1 = 1$

- For element at position (1,2): $1 + 0 = 1$

- For element at position (2,1): $1 + 0 = 1$

- For element at position (2,2): $0 + 1 = 1$



Therefore, A + B is:

$ A+B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix} $

**Question in English**: Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, B=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, calculate A+B.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate A+B, we need to perform matrix addition.



Matrix addition is done by adding corresponding elements of the two matrices. If the matrices have the same dimensions (i.e., the same number of rows and columns), then we can add them.



Given the matrices $ A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix} $ and $ B=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} $, we can see that they have the same dimensions (2x2), so we can add them.



To add the matrices, we add the elements in the same position:



$ A+B = \begin{pmatrix}0+1 & 1+0\\1+0 & 0+1\end{pmatrix} $



$ A+B = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix} $



Therefore, $ A+B = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}} $

**Question in Chinese**: 已知向量a=(1, 2, 3), b=(4, 5, 6)，计算a与b的外积。

**Question in English**: Given the vectors a=(1, 2, 3), b=(4, 5, 6), calculate the outer product of a and b.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the outer product of two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3), we need to create a 3x3 matrix where the element at row i and column j is the product of the ith component of vector a and the jth component of vector b.



Given a = (1, 2, 3) and b = (4, 5, 6), we can calculate the outer product as follows:



The outer product of a and b is a 3x3 matrix where:



- The element at row 1 and column 1 is a1*b1 = 1*4 = 4

- The element at row 1 and column 2 is a1*b2 = 1*5 = 5

- The element at row 1 and column 3 is a1*b3 = 1*6 = 6

- The element at row 2 and column 1 is a2*b1 = 2*4 = 8

- The element at row 2 and column 2 is a2*b2 = 2*5 = 10

- The element at row 2 and column 3 is a2*b3 = 2*6 = 12

- The element at row 3 and column 1 is a3*b1 = 3*4 = 12

- The element at row 3 and column 2 is a3*b2 = 3*5 = 15

- The element at row 3 and column 3 is a3*b3 = 3*6 = 18



Therefore, the outer product of a and b is:



$$ \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 8 & 10 & 12 \\ 12 & 15 & 18 \end{bmatrix} $$

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the outer product of vectors a and b, we need to multiply each element of a by each element of b. 



The outer product of two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3) results in a 3x3 matrix.



a = (1, 2, 3)

b = (4, 5, 6)



Outer product:

|  4  5  6  |

|  8 10 12  |

| 12 15 18  |



So, the outer product of vectors a and b is:

\boxed{

|  4  5  6  |

|  8 10 12  |

| 12 15 18  |

}

**Question in Chinese**: 已知向量a=(1, 2, 3), b=(4, 5, 6)，计算a与b的外积。

**Question in English**: Given the vectors a=(1, 2, 3), b=(4, 5, 6), calculate the outer product of a and b.

**Model's answer:**

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;">

To calculate the outer product of vectors a and b, we need to find a matrix where each element of vector a is multiplied with each element of vector b.



Step 1:  Let's represent vector a as (1, 2, 3) and vector b as (4, 5, 6).



Step 2:  To calculate the outer product, we multiply the elements of a with the elements of b.



Step 3:  Multiplying each element of a with 4:

   - 1 * 4 = 4

   - 2 * 4 = 8

   - 3 * 4 = 12



Step 4:  Multiplying each element of a with 5:

   - 1 * 5 = 5

   - 2 * 5 = 10

   - 3 * 5 = 15



Step 5:  Multiplying each element of a with 6:

   - 1 * 6 = 6

   - 2 * 6 = 12

   - 3 * 6 = 18



Step 6:  Arrange these results into a matrix format where each row represents the elements of a and each column represents the elements of b:

   | 4  5  6 |

   | 8 10 12 |

   | 12 15 18|



This is the outer product of vectors a and b.
