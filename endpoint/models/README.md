# Models

This project uses original models trained and fine-tuned by their respective teams, without any change to the model themselves.

Used models are:
- [`Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct) (commit 33c19302) 
- [`deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-instruct`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-instruct) (commit 0a5828f) 
- [`mistralai/Mathstral-7B-v0.1`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mathstral-7B-v0.1) (commit b6408c3) 
- [`meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) (commit 0e9e39f) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project duplicates the respective models' weights for benchmarking purposes, and it doesn't own any credits to the model. So, please be mindful of that and respect the original license of the model.

Replicas of each model have been uploaded to Hugging Face for further deployment. Because the models are too large to be placed here, you can refer to them there. See [Quick deployment Guide](../README.md#quick-deployment-guide) for repository links.
