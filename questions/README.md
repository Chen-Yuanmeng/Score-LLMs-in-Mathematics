# Adding questions for the test

## Formal question set

There are 6 `json` files under this folder. These are the 6 question sets for different categories that we will test the models with.

## Legacy files

The `legacy` folder contains all the script and uploaded files generated by the team members during the process. These include:
- `instructions.md` and `assets`: the upload process documentation
- `get_input.py`: the script used to generate JSON-serialized questions
- `output` folder: all original uploads from team members
