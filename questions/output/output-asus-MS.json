        "Question in Chinese": "令某厂生产的节能灯的使用寿命服从 $Exp (1/6000)$．经过技术革新后，该厂生产出一批新的节能灯，从中取出20个节能灯来做实验，预定到第5个失效时试验停止，而测得前5个节能灯的工作时间（单位： h ）分别为6000,6300,6600,6700,6800.问在显著性水平为0.05时，技术革新后节能灯的平均寿命是否提高了？",
        "Question in English": "Let the service life of energy-saving lamps produced by a certain factory follow $Exp (1/6000)$. After technical innovation the factory produced a new batch of energy-saving lamps. 20 energy-saving lamps were taken out for experimentation, and the experiment was stopped when the 5 one failed. The working times of the first 5 energy-saving lamps (in hours) were measured to be 6000, 6300 6600, 6700, and 6800, respectively. Has the average life of the energy-saving lamps increased after technical innovation at a significance level of 0.05?",
